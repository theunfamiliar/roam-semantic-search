            - Why [[men]] can't get it up. #shnub
                - ppl are supposed to be free. can't stand the thought of sex becoming boring. What I learned from that guy's drunken rant in White Lotus.
                - She says commitment issues. I say boredom issues. What's the difference?
                - You might hear of a guy who gets a lot of pussy who can't get it up - like me - but that was fatigue, and is quickly overcome. Most chronic cases are mental. The dick gives up. The man is beaten down. He's not surrounded by anything turning him on and he has no reason to think he's going to become the kind of man that will get close to something that's gonna turn him on.
                - Because they're fucking the same woman too much.
            - Besides being sociopathic, being extra interested in someone you don't know is plain weird. Natural human relationships thaw slow. #shnub
                - [[Loan]] told me about her sociopath ex-boyfriends, who were extra charming to completely strangers early on - which really is the nuts part when you think about it - then went bonkers. Told Loan I'm completely the opposite, the way it should be. Aren't you lucky. 
            - The night when you finally fuck her. and afterwards you ask why she liked you and you compare notes. #shnub
            - Looking for something that tastes as good as it smells. #shnub
            - The aggressor strikes, with something hard. The prey is emptiness, waiting to be taken. That's men and women. That's why we have a double standard. It ain't the same. #shnub
                - Tuesday I worked and juggled calls and emails while doing burpees in front of Bree while talking on the phone while throwing a dead mouse in the trash chute. Bree decided to come with me to the Shrine to see Louis King so I told Chavs work was too hectic and we went. Louis King did a Kendrick impression while his partner did a Cole impression. Bruse Wane was funny at WHCR. King James was cool. Bruse drove us uptown then we cabbed the rest. At Shrine I ate sautéed cauliflower and ratatouille while [[Bree]] told me she had three fiances, the first of whom she fucked his frat brother, then the second she fucked his actual brother. Then she shrugged like she always does and we sat in silence. She asked me why I cheated. I told her because I wasn’t that attracted to her. I let it go when I reminded myself that I’m leaving anyway, and part of me is aroused by thinking of her as some jumpoff. The next day wacking off to porn I realized I get more horny wacking off thinking about her, because I feel validated by making some old Bronx Jamaican jumpoff get wet. She told me she had an abortion at almost six months. I can’t with her. Can I judge her for that decision? Or the decision to be a cokehead? Or all the other shit she’s told me about her life? She stabbed her fucking ex-boyfriend. Cheated on two fiancees with their brothers. When bad things happen to you in your youth you spend a long time after that just reacting and dealing. And she’s recovered as well as can be expected. But all I can think about is her belching. And her bloody tampons. And foul mouth. And just general wrecked demeanor. I’m not from her world. If she wants to be with a guy like me she has to do more to show me a smoother side. She has some kind of fetish about bodily odor and pee and sweat. Pain and pleasure are all tangled up. She thinks it’s cute she routinely cuts me and bites me in bed. After a fresh set of cuts this week I for some reason and a bit angry about it. It’s just getting really old.  Her silent subtext is that she’s a modern woman who wants to get fucked hard by a big dick just like I wanna get fucked hard by a fat ass, and she has a right to lust like a man does. But she agrees that the difference between lesbians and gays is that gay sex is invasive. It’s a pounding. She’s taken so many poundings. Then the drugs, the family, and the way she still goes after danger. I do not like it. And of course part of this is all my insecurities. Of course her past has damaged her. Of course we’re skirting around the likelihood that we’re doomed as a couple by drinking and smoking and fucking. Of course this could end ugly. Sometimes I feel like I want her to break down and repent for all the shit she did. She says she’s not proud of it but she’s still so angry and that anger now is half self-righteousness, like it’s white people’s fault her family was fucked up and fucked her up, when as far as I can see, racism definitely squeezed them from all angles to breaking point, but ultimately the hands that dealt her pain weren’t white hands, they were the hands of black people, the hands of her family. Have pity. You’re dealing with a wounded woman. What do you want her to do? Break down? You’re leaving too. Be kind. Share. Keep your autonomy. You’re not here to save her. You’re here to be you. The rest is extra credit.

            - I'm single because I'm busy & picky. And because marriage sounds boring. And I'm obsessed with how to __spin the net__, __thread the needle__. #shnub
                - The burden of knowing you’re limitless. Looked at all the emails you’ve never emailed today and all the ones still floating out there and gnawed your mouth to shreds and ended up in the bar at 2:30pm. The vastness of the task and the excitement; the idea that you can actually do it. 
                - “One thing I have never understood is how to work it so that when you’re married, things keep happening to you. Things happen to you when you’re single. You meet new men, you travel alone, you learn new tricks, you read Trollope, you try sushi, you buy nightgowns, you shave your legs. Then you get married, and the hair grows in. I love the everydayness of marriage, I love figuring out what’s for dinner and where to hang the pictures and do we owe the Richardsons, but life does tend to slow to a crawl.”

            - Chicks I fucked with in the 90s. #LA  #shnub
                - I went crazy for a Persian chick named Negar in my photography class, which I appreciated because I still love photography. She played me low for some Mexican dude named Oscar who I think was hitting her. That was the advancement of my save a ho complex, where I put girls on a pedestal who ignored me for assholes because I thought they didn’t know any better. He tried to add me on Facebook recently and she spent a little while several years back trying to get me on her page. 
                - Sharona, the girl who would only suck Donnell's dick, but she licked my balls instead. #women
                    - Sharona was maybe the only Persian girl I ever got down with. She was hot back in the day. She used to fuck around with a gangsta prettyboy named Donnell. She told me his dick was the only one she’d suck, but she could suck my balls, and she did. 
                - I developed a real love for blowjobs. It’s the ultimate submission. A beautiful women with all her games and tricks, reduced to choking on your dick, staring up at you with that pretty wet face. 
                    - Tony EQ hooked me up with his girlfriend’s friend, a chubby gorgeous Mexican chick who blew me to within an inch of my life in a motel room in East LA. 
                    - There was some dumb young black chick with a tongue ring who I tortuously talked into blowing me in the back of my car. By the time she did it I was so horny I just blew it off immediately. 
                - These were the years where I discovered the internet as a source for everything in my life from information to music to money to women. I’d always dreamed of some machine with every song in the world and suddenly there it was. No more copying CDs to tape and returning them five times in a day. No more mail-order soul CDs. I downloaded every song I’d ever liked. I got on Yahoo chat as mr_malkovich and it led to tons of pussy. I didn’t yet know that I’d become a publicist and make my money by treating the whole internet like one big Yahoo chat. Yahoo taught me to get really turned on by chat. To this day I often prefer it to the real thing. It’s safer. You can get into a girl’s mind. You can be more artful with your seduction. By the time you see her next, she’s ready. No bullshit. Straight to work. It tends to sexualize things faster, but if a girl can get broken down by my tricks then it might as well happen sooner than later. 
                    - The first girl I met was on some other chat site and turned out to have battery acid burns on her face, and I’m pretty sure I ran into her years later because those burns were very specific. 
                    - A girl with a weird chin who came over and blew me. That black girl who came over quite a few times and got straight to business, pretty but with messed up teeth. 
                    - Darling Montalvo, a Mexican girl from Bakersfield who had a kid but was just fucking gorgeous and one night after seeing me perform she finally came over and fooled around with me. I pretended to like her. I used to pretend to like girls a lot, I guess because I thought that’s what they wanted. I googled her in 2022 and she did two years for wire fraud.
                    - Darrah, one of the best blowjobs ever. 
                    - The pale Mexican girl from East LA who it never happened with. 
                    - I spent a few nights putting up Christmas lights in downtown Santa Clarita and met a hot Mexican girl who came to mom’s house and let me screw around with her but she kept talking about her dead brother. #shnub
                    - The punk rock Mexican chick with the lowkey great body who I had tons of fun with then ignored me. 
                    - Some skanchy hood chick I visited in Pasadena and just grabbed ass. We spent the night at her friend’s place, some big faux-fancy looking spot, and I spent all night on a frilly couch with her. 
                    - Regina and Jacinda, two girls I had internet romances with but never met and caused me lots of heartache. 
                    - The Las Vegas girl who promised to meet me at the airport and obviously didn’t. 
                    - Jocelyn with the great ass, I couldn’t believe her when I went to pick her up in Fontana and she walked out. Amazing. 
                    - Yolanda, who came to my Skeletons release party then went home and blew my head off. 
                - I’m reminded of a girl I found on the street who I took to Kris’s house and she was basically trying to blow me on the spot. We were on his roof and I was having a conversation with Kris while she was kneeling with her head in my crotch, just waiting for orders. It’d only make them hungrier when I’d play it cool when in reality I was scared of pulling my dick out and coming immediately. 
                - Charles brought a big booty Haitian chick named Nadine over and she grinded all over me but my dick remained dormant out of fear. 
                - Orly and I used to grind all night in his room. She was in Israeli girl and one of my hottest early girl memories. Most of those nights Aubrey Binzer would also be in the room, a pretty white girl who had zero interest in me because she was from a cool connected LA family and she had plenty of action and entertainment, plus no ass so I wasn’t even working at it. I overlooked her like I always do white girls. Her brother ended up being the singer in Crazy Town and a couple times I went to her house off Olympic I was in a room with Alchemist. 
                - There was a chunkier Mexican chick who got her head banged hard in his toilet by me for a whole night. 
                - There was that nutty girl with the big ass who got naked fast and crazy quickly after and we had to get her out. 
                - There was the girl I went to the Block at Orange to see but she was getting painted by a street painter when I showed up and I looked at the painting and the painting was ugly so I got outta there. 
                - There was the fat handicapped girl whose house the crew used as a crash pad. I vaguely remember iodine spilled all over the toilet, or was it period blood?
                - There was the Bentley house across the street from Kris’s second apartment where Pengo and everyone used to hang, where I did shrooms changed my life a bit. and then wandered off around West LA having a bad trip. First time I ever did shrooms was at someone’s house in Brentwood. The first thing I remember was the edges of the TV going real multi-colored and it sounded like someone was playing with the treble and the balance on the stereo. 
                    - Every time I do shrooms changed my life a bit. I feel like my scar on the back of my head is leaking, and then I find one hair in my mouth. 
                    - I also shroomed with Ben once when he had his own place in Westwood. I stayed up all night listening to Killarmy and reading World’s Most Dangerous Places. 
                    - I shroomed at a party in Brentwood and it was like the edges of the TV were old and someone was playing with the treble and the walls were breathing, and the world was just the world with no rules or ideas, just walls and organisms. 
                - There were girls like Brandy, a big friendly white girl who was obviously homeless and I heard got her throat slit in the Sahara motel in Hollywood. #downfall #shnub
                - Anthony hooked me up with a Cuban chick who blew me in my Civic on my way to drop her off at home, and every time she saw me. She went on to try porn and was the subject of a porn site blog post all about how two old guys destroyed her and sent her running screaming out of the porn business. 
                - We did a show in Santa Barbara (met Masta Ace in a restaurant that night) and behind the frat house we performed at was an orderly line of half of us waiting to get their dicks sucked by this chick who was on her knees between the cars. #shnub
                - I saw a girl walking from Petco down Doheny in a Petco uniform and went to her house but her mattress had fleas obviously. #shnub
                - I met a Mexican girl in Palm Springs and drove all the way to her house a week later in the 909, spent a night doing heavy petting but avoided fucking because I knew I’d blow fast. She did the ignoring after that.
                - Ditto this amazing hot black girl Paul hooked me up with who took me to her house and asked me repeatedly if I was sure I didn’t want to fuck. She introduced me to Blackalicious’s first EP. 
                - There was Khadijah, the Avco cinema cashier who had a craterface but that was back when I was enamored of just about any hood chick and didn’t give a shit. 
                - There was the ultimate hood chick, the big one who looked cute enough in her pictures but when I went down to Long Beach she was bigger than me in every way, wearing a blue Pendleton. 
                - Along Khadijah’s lines there was the similarly crater-faced black chick I me at SMC and she took me to her place on Saturn St. She had big titties and a decent frame though, even if she disowned me pretty swiftly. 
                - There was the light-skinned chick with the tongue ring and juicy mouth who I went to the beach with. A video chick, a cool chick, the kind I always wanted so of course I was nervous. She was the classic LA hot chick, hot then cold and can’t even remember ever being hot. She was friends with another hot little Mexican chick who posted a Myspace rant about how she likes 90s rap but not any of us who remotely sound even like we’re trying to do it. Those were my early days of rejection. I think they were at a show I did at the Knitting Factory. #downfall
                - Reminds me of Sophie, the fat latin chick who I first met at that BLX/Fatlip show in Santa Monica, then blew me for hours in my car next to that bar I used to DJ in Silverlake, then offhandedly told me she didn’t like my new stuff years later. I still sigh when I read these things. #downfall
                - There was that Salvadoran chick Cynthia, who had some nice titties and even Ron remarked that I must like this one, but she quickly just fell off into Uglyville like Salvadoran chicks do. Funny how we’ve stayed in touch ever since though. 
                - There was Emily, Ron’s friend from Philly, a tall slim light-skinned black chick who I may have fooled around with. I can’t remember. 
                - There was Nava, one of my first hardcore crushes and one of my last white girls. Charles (who also connected me with a pretty Asian girl named Marina who I think blew me off, and some chubby Mexican friend of his very hot ex Feh who blew me deep and hard late at night to the morning on his bathroom floor) was messing around with this pretty Asian chick with huge titties named Chin Chin (who I think used to mess around with Atoome, the tall good-looking guy who ran with the Asian Mafia and got killed according to Charles) and he put me on the phone with her friend. We talked for hours at a time for weeks to months, then finally I went to her house, which I thought was ages away but turned out to only be in Mar Vista. I slid through her sliding glass window and sat in her room like a stranger until we had some long kiss time then I bounced then she played me ice cold and I just couldn’t understand it. Since they went to L.A.C.E.S., that reminds me of the party some kids from that school threw when Leonardo DiCaprio was there by the keg. 
                - There was the girl from Arizona, looked kinda native American, she blew me a few times and even invited me to some mansion she was sitting in the hills. 
                - Ana Santaolalla was an Argentine daughter of some director guy who would blow me all the time, in hotel rooms, vacant apartments, anywhere. 
                - Sean one day found an ad in LA Xpress saying we could make $35 doing some kind of sex work. Soon after we showed up at some nondescript brick building in the valley that had a line of men coming out the front door. A big hunchback with gnarled fingers, a twiny ponytail and a big growth on his neck was checking everyone. Inside we were told to strip to boxers and shoes. We were led into a studio soundstage and told to sit on the ground. A good-looking latin woman came out in black leather lingerie and kneeled at one end of the studio. The plan was when the guy claps once we all stand up. When he claps again we stand up and take our boxers off. On the third clap we throw our boxers at the chick and yell “BUKKAKE”. We stayed in the back so we wouldn’t have to take our boxers off. After that, they said we were supposed to masturbate all over her face. Some guys had gotten tested prior, which means they were allowed to cum in her mouth. All we could do was drop the load on her face. [pauses to marvel at the fact that he actually came on a strange porn star’s face] Some old white bikers in the corner had obviously done this before because they had machetes and raw aloe vera, wacking off with one hand and slicing vegetation with the other. As I was stepping up to cum a huge black guy did the same on the opposite side of her and I dodged a wad of cum. On the way out a bathroom was cracked and I heard a woman getting banged against the toilet. 
                - One of my first girlfriends was a black chick from Beverly Hills called Tracy Parker. Talk about a perfect example of a young match. We didn’t have problems. We just didn’t make any sense together. We didn’t even sleep together. 
                - [[Nikiya]]. After high school I spent three years at Santa Monica College, treading water. I’d pass one class, drop out of another, fail a third. After making it to geometry in high school I tested right back into high school algebra at SMC, and tried two or three times to pass before a rapidly closing loophole allowed me to satisfy my Cal State math requirements if I only pass a symbolic logic class, which I did. SMC was where I did one of my first performances, with Eddie. “tighter than Oprah in biker shorts” was what the presenter repeated when we were done. SMC was where my friendship with [[Nikiya]] became a relationship. I met her through one of the very first girls I ever messed with after moving to America, Charla, who Michelle hooked me up with. Nikiya was Charla’s friend and she’d come to Charla’s place when I was there. We got along fast and soon she was one of the crew. We’d mob around town middle of the night on the bus and she’d be right there with us. She was Eddie’s girlfriend first, then Kyros’, and even kissed Justin, but all the time she was my best friend. She slept in my bed and we never did a thing for two years. Science class homework had us in my room for an extra long time. We started fooling around to make homework more interesting. One day she started crying and told me she’d caught herpes from her boyfriend who she’d lost her virginity to. It freaked me out but I researched and took the precautions and felt okay about it. We had a good relationship. She worked at Koo Koo Roo in Beverly Hills. I would pick her up and she’d be in that crisp white uniform. Her dad__Larue__ and stepmom Ziva liked me. I loved Nikiya. It could have been forever, and that’s why I let it go. We settled into that relationship routine that partners are supposed to relish in: pizza, movies, recreation. But I couldn’t do it. I was 20. It was no time for free time. I had to make something of myself. Besides, we were wearing on each other’s nerves. She had a way of being brusque, blunt. It pissed me off. She just wasn’t that hot. And over time the herpes thing played havoc with my mind. Towards the end we barely even had sex and she mentioned that a lot. My nuts started itching one day and I went nuts and blamed her. She came to my house. I told her we should break up. She slapped me and caught a cab home. She didn’t talk to me for a year or so. One day she ended up back at my place, and she blew me. 
                - Brenda. Somewhere around this time I fell for a Mexican girl named Brenda Gallegos. I met her online. She lived in San Diego. I went down there for Valentine’s Day and she took me to a party. We sat in the car by her house making out till the morning then she snuck me in after her family went off to work and we messed around some more. She was hot, with big tits and ass. I went hook line and sinker. Then she found out she was pregnant with her ex-boyfriend’s kid. They’d been boning just before I showed up. I was undeterred. I actually entertained being with her regardless. Actually I don’t know if I really did entertain it. I don’t think even I was that crazy. I think I was just riding the situation until the wheels fell off. I took the train to San Diego and she was waiting for me outside, I saw her through the windows in her black leather pants. We went out then she blew me in the back seat of her car, swallowed all my cum, then belched and smiled. She came up to L.A. and slept over my house. That’s insane, looking back. Her ex was trying to get her back and I was refusing to leave the picture. Then she told me she’d miscarried, and that she was going back to her ex to try to work things out. I took it hard and long. That was a transformative heartache.
                  
                - Patty Morales was a slightly older girl, part of another sector of kids I always considered cooler than me. I considered her out of my league. Then we started seeing each other. It’s funny how little I remember about this one since it hit me pretty hard. I think I just remember her coming back from a long phone conversation outside and she told me she was going back to her ex. It was almost funny to me. Just so clockwork. I had been here before. All I could do was laugh and let it go. I’d heard about him before and I think she had told me she was considering it. I should have let it go right there. We went to New Orleans for Halloween. We had a hotel room and we had sex but it wasn’t good. I came too fast or I couldn’t get it up. I remember her sucking my dick like it was a chore. We took the train to Atlanta and stayed with Dex. 
                  
                - Yvette Pinon is a salsa dancer with a huge great ass. I met her on Yahoo and went out with her a couple of times then I think she just disappeared. I was shook by how big her ass was and I think I crowded her. We reconnected a while later. I’d go stay at her house in South Central. She worked at s private school in Brentwood and I’d go by there and on lunches take her to the park up the street. We went to water parks, she came to the beach with me and hung with my friends. I went to her salsa club in the city of Industry. Then, finally, I slept at her house and we fucked. I was bad. She was a classic example of a girl I wasn’t really into who I was hanging with because she was just too fine.

            - You get as far away from your own dick as possible. So she’s sucking a disembodied piece of meat. That’s how we like it.  #shnub

She fronted on me for years, disappeared, then reappeared one day as a makeup artist for Stevie Wonder to slap my dick against her face. I hung out with her at her Melrose apartment a few times then she disappeared again, caught a crazy disease and called me with a paranoid rant which she later apologized for under heavy skin makeup.

                        - I seem to do well with the quiet ones. The good fucks bounce. Two great blowjobs I’ve had lately, both from runners, stuck on taller, blonder foreigners. I’m some kind of weird dark side dude. So be it. All this shit is side shit to me. All of it. 
                    - you get along with the smart loners.
                    - [[Loan]] and __Lilith__: two twisted youngsters with dead dads. __death__

                    - [[killers]] so far is all Asian girls. I mean.. most of the others are fat. Asian girls are Asian girls. They are hot.
                    - __girls who actually liked me__ is long. Take a bow.
                    - The fat asses still intimidate you, because you'd last 8 seconds. Which is seven seconds more than you used to last. #shnub #killers
                    - __girls I actually liked__ are almost never [[killers]], and no Amazons are anywhere. Hợp lý. You want them too much and you fumble, you know this. Or they don't have the brains so you try to fill that void with your yammering when all they understand is big dick energy and you fumble. You are looking for all three and you haven't found it. I still haven't found what I'm looking for, word to U2. Maybe [[her]] won't be a smoke show Amazon, but that's what I need under my belt in order to be ready for her. 
                    - __girls I actually liked__ are transparently smarter and deeper than the rest, and deserve to be treated differently.

                        - Loser chicks and winners. Tattooist photography producers, young hoteliers vs girls who will drink all over town just hoping they run into you. 
                        - The big worry isn’t that you make gigantic mistakes. It’s that you’re so far off the mark that you can’t even see it. #women #downfall
                        - Some very fit white girls milling around with fat asses. A friend of Jessica’s just married one, and she’s my reminder of the week that I’m dealing with a bunch of sub-par broads. A piece like that, I wouldn’t think twice about being faithful. 
                        - __scared__ of getting fucked up, coronavirus, marching, taking a stand. I ain't bout shit. The world wants to go down the tubes. Not me. __I fumble [[killers]]__ #politics #Marty #downfall
                        - Margaret Tra, a little good old-fashioned [[Nature Boy]] outing. __I don't think I'm Someone enough yet for a Someone Type Woman. __. I met girls like me. And they're normally leaving. You located the throbbing pussy in your heart after a couple of lonely weekends and now it’s a hot potato you want to throw at someone as fast as possible. Nam said in Vietnamese culture, romantic people are also the people “who have to do a lot of hard things.” #women
                        - __jealous__ boy stands around creepy and __aloof__ while mentally stalking Priyanka at __Nillay__'s [Indian]([[India]]) wedding. Same shit I felt around the time of [[Rojeanne]]'s wedding: I'm just a boy while everyone else is moving on, and in India, inheriting hot women just because they're male and alive. After twenty minutes of watching Priyanka enjoy her own life with her family I went upstairs and went to sleep, dejected. How am I going to afford marriage? Michael was telling Rojeanne he thinks it’s time to start a family. How much less deluded am I than he is? There was a time when me talking to a gorgeous young girl from a rich family might have set fire to the place. We’d be buoyed through the motions by a wave of energy. Now if it happens it will be a fluke, a favor, my age will be something to deal with. Or maybe I’m talking loser madness. I saw a bunch of really beautiful girls in a wedding, with a guy on horseback spending a hundred thousand dollars of his daddy’s money. I saw guys basically inheriting hot women. Don’t I have some kind of birthright? What am I entitled to? When is the easy part coming? I’m going to have to summon up a bunch of energy for the life I’ve signed up for, the life of an older man entertaining a younger woman and raising kids, and being an artist and a businessman. What’s going to come easy for me? When is it coming? Is my life hard? And if it is, am I the one making it hard? #mixed
                        - [[women]] and particularly [[Vietnamese girls]] love married guys - who keep hand by definition - and European exes, guys who are something. I am nothing. #me
                        - Today you were walking in Milan and saw The Italian Girl. Looked almost Mexican. Face, body, ASS. And one of those clean well-kept beauties that made you look in the mirror and see an old sloppy pervert. Am I bad? I masturbate, I use women for sex and I’ve almost never been faithful. What kind of men do women like her want? Non-creative stable types? Do I want a woman like that? 
                    - The fat asses still intimidate you, because you'd last 8 seconds. Which is seven seconds more than you used to last, mr __fast__. #killers
                        - I spent a shitload of time with Yvette Pinon for one reason and one only. And I had one of the most emasculating nights of my life with her. 
                        - Standing in Heather's living room cumming on yourself.
                        - For you it's all mental. When a girl does that crazy porn shit you cum almost immediately just from the mere sight of it, not even the feeling.
                        - But Je'Nai does illuminate the fact that yes, I am a fuckboy. Maybe one with more standards but still a fuckboy. Put another way, I’m a kiss ass. I bend over backwards and stick my neck out for these girls who shit all over me, because maybe one day they’ll come to their senses and fuck me, because that’s pretty much all I want from a butterface like Je’Nai. The hot ones (meaning: fat ass) get all the breaks while the average ones get treated worse. It should be the other way around. They don’t respect me because they see how easy I give my time away to them, answering their messages fast, available today or tomorrow if’s better for you, whatever. My game is tired. It’s tired because it’s game. I have two modes. Total nuking with honeys and babies and fake big dick talk when a little girl like Ms Bui clapped back at me for 30 seconds and exposed the fraud. The millisecond you give up control you lose it all. Maybe that’s why you’re off Bui. Can you imagine what would happen if Je’Nai clapped back on you? You’d disappear into a dwarf star. You pretend you’re a loverman but you gave up on that long ago for manipulation games because there’s still a big secret in the middle of all of it – you’re not this tough guy fuck em to death character, it’s all alcohol and it doesn’t work when they fuck you back. Your excited feelings feel too familiar. Girls get excited in kind because they feel the same thing you profess to feel. But it’s not even real anymore. It’s the only part that was still half real. Then the other setting is dad. Sterotypical observations about people that you think are charming and real but are actually stale and very boring. 
                        - Little dick romantics and big dick assholes. #women #hand
                            - Pretty dumb chicks and smart ugly ones. We are what we have to be. But hey.. if you have a little dick, get a little lady. Stay in vietnam, lil dick. They unmasked my secret. I disfigured my life to prove I’m not a little dick sucker for love soft mamas boy. And now I’m probably gonna hate them for it. 
                        - And that expands outwards. A crazy hot passionate woman, like mom of course, who is gonna annoy you and get you into fights and take you through this rollercoaster of love and hate and force you to either become a good human being or you lose her and retire to Southeast Asia as you've already done, and quite early. The only thing you've ever been early for is this phase of your life: the giving up and retreating into white man's fantasyland phase. 
                        - I seem to do well with the quiet ones. The good fucks bounce. Duh, they’re getting fucked harder by bigger guys, guys who don’t need to talk. That post-language shit.
                        - You drink a lot so you can numb up enough to fuck a bunch of them hard, and seem hard, not the softy that you are. You chat all day with any chick who will allow you to, enacting your ultimate fantasy of being that guy in the porno flick who just lays around with his big dick hanging out while girls creep up between his legs and make themselves cum from deepthroating him while he watches TV. A man completely in control of them and they love it because that’s women at the core. Sometimes you are that guy. Rarely with the really hot ones. They intimidate you, and you also just tend not to get along with them much, because they’re so busy being hot they don’t have time to be a person. But those dimes are out there, successful and educated and worldly and drop dead gorgeous, and you quite rarely get even a sniff of those. You’re too busy walking around some dumpster in the middle of nowhere, entranced by the dirt and the street. But you could become that guy now. You can be a rich businessman type. You actually must, if you want this to all work.

                - lust
                    - A transient desire. Pawing at beauty. #shnub
                        - And as I look back at a weekend just days ago where I had two brand new idiots in my bed, and worried about the fallout, and I look at today when they're gone, and I look at a raft of new ones, and I think about how [[Mai Huc]] just left my bed and our sex was.. just sex, like all this new is gonna be, I have to conclude that it's really all just silly, and not worth much. This transient desire.
                        - Undoubtedly the other Dakar was there (the Dakar of the four hundred and sixteen dead, of the despair and injustice), but something else was momentarily shining through, something that was always stubbornly exciting. So in an early Rene Clair film one could believe that this was the life one was born to live, breaking through life as one had been made to live it, breaking through anxiety and irritation and financial depression and a lust that had gone on too long, these voices in the air, this chase of a lottery ticket among the flying opera-hats, this tuneful miniature love behind cardboard scenery. 
                    - Alcohol and lust, dreams we were sold. #shnub
                        - __Roxy__ couldn't do it for you, forget about it. You've been to the top, homey.
                        - why do you want it? this time will be different. marketing. an easy scratch. and it's nice to tell yourself the one can always be close. the idea that she's not is too nasty. 
                        - My taste, no, more, my need, obsession in females is so boilerplate. Marketing? I got suckered in bad.
            - [[bitches]]
                - __fakeass__
                    - When a woman goes through a life of being extremely smart but also treated like a sex object, it drives them nuts.
                    - Girls just want money, guys just want sex. Nobody's holier than thou in this situation. 
                    - hot then cold fast girls. [[women]] always ask "why can't I just find a normal guy". Most of them are going to either bother you too much or leave you completely alone and lonely unless you hop on the pot in short order. __women want all of you and then some__
                        - __Nikki Lashae__ and __Tasha__ are perfect examples. This phrase has a definition. They were extremely friendly in the beginning but once they decide you're of no use, they go sour on a dime. You're literally saying to yourself on the first date __this woman is way too hot to be this nice to me. Why is this happening?__ #[[lừa đảo]]
                            - Was reminded of my facetime with __Seble__ earlier where she said “you’re kind of a playboy. You say this stuff too easy.” I have been selling so hard to women and clients lately. __chasing__'s what I do. #me #shnub

                    - __Rainbow__
                        - Saw Rainbow stomping down rhe street in the new Old Quarter sucking candy. Realized that, yeah, she helped me, but she didn't say that shit to help me. She said it to be a dick. 
                    - Sheilah
                    - do you feel like you were particularly interesting up to this point? or do you think I just reserved judgment in order to let things unfold

                - __slutty__
                    - Coffee Tea Or Me. Ugly little dog named Tiger, who was all mine for exactly three minutes then did the identical thing with a new table of tourists. Even the dogs are prostitutes. 
                    - 1st pic ass out? yeah, I'll make a call. 
                        - Girls winking in their pictures are probably hookers.
                        - She knows what she's got. A lot of guys also know. She's in a lot of similar conversations. You'll be another of those guys unless you try to be different. But she's retarded so what's the point? a new chick i barely pay attention to. baldy. bonnie. everyone else knows better. now this jumpoff. We were all just nakedly needy. I'm so fucking lonely. let me love you. the baby voice. 
                - __dumb__
                    - __dumb__ [Middle Eastern]([[Iran]]) __Trump__er [[women]]. See: __Vietnamese girls see in black and white__. Natural [[hand]]. the hot/dumb inverse relationship that lets you know there's no god. #women, but considerably less hand when you're [[Bree]] and [[women]] who go have their fun then wanna foist themselves on you when they're all clapped up.
                        - 'moderate' will murder you on [[tinder]]
                            - When you say moderate on Tinder, all the lib girls avoid you and maybe you get recommended more to the conservatives? In any event, we 
                        - __Shabby__. Her store name is Organique, for Christ's sake.
                        - __Armenian [[women]]__
                            - A gorgeous woman matches me on Bumble. She has a picture sitting down. She is literally sitting on rolls of ass flesh. I ask her where she's from. Armenia. Oh, no. No, no, no. One word answers. She says she's never been to Armenia. I ask her how she feels about that, knowing full well that will be the end of the conversation. How does she feel about it? She probably never even thought about it once. 
                        - __Persian Jewish [[women]]__
                            - Another day, another retarded middle Eastern vocational worker. This one is a psychologist who got pissed because she told me she was the youngest and I called her "the brat". She said "that was salty", similar to how a girl earlier that day said "hot girls can be lots of fun" when I gave her my usual __tired__ shpiel about how hot girls are boring. They fucking are though. I'm this close to just going after average broads now.
                            - Farnaz is a Persian Jewish woman of 38. She went to Taft, with the Persian Muslims. She now lives in Westwood, as she's supposed to. Her mother still lives in the valley, two doors down from her sister, who is rich and takes trips to resorts and buys Prada bags and doesn't give Farnaz one of them. Farnaz is Franky and Mahnaz. She spends her time helping her family and has no time for her own personal life. She's a registered nurse, which is for sure more helpful on this planet than I'll ever be. She asks me how long I've been on the apps and why I haven't found someone yet, as if you can only find people on the apps. She says I talk black and got very quiet when I told her I have indeed had sex with black women. She asks me why I'm not married despite being basically 40 herself. She says the white guys are weird, cheap. Guys who cook for the week and don't eat out. She likes steak and sushi, asked nobody. Drives a Benz, wants the better one. Asked if we could go to the Wynn Hotel in Vegas for Valentine's Day and hours later never wants to talk to me again. Persian Muslim men find out she's jewish and hang up immediately. Thinks Matt is a 'repair man'. Said 'front yard' ten times when I told her about Rojeanne's wedding. Delivered groceries to a lazy white guy who was fucking some fat chick in Cannes and now she's pissed.  Does not like black people, or my accent.

                    - Can’t play word games with hot women, particularly hot foreign women. They're too dumb to understand it and they don't need to. They can smell you and they're always catered to.
                    - Working out your body and not your brain is like a guy working out his arms and not his legs. It’s off. You’re not gonna keep someone like that. __Huong Asami__ drags them in with a first class ass then gets pissed when it turns out that’s all they’re here for. Maybe if you exercised your brain better it wouldn’t be that way.
                    - Being friends with a guy who you're not attracted to is easy.

                    - Fear of downfall and a general insecurity + a feeling of debt + guilt regarding women which manifests as an urge to please them + a feeling of not being a man + too many ideas = I attempt to become Superman but lost myself in the process.. One girl slipped through the cracks, and when she left I grew a beard. A good girl came to me and I cheated. I aged 5 years in 1. I concluded I'd failed at love, career and art, and had basically become my dad, so I threw everything away to become someone else, maybe him, maybe someone else. I developed a life plan: [[The Big Nut]]. I'd spent my youth trying to belong to England, then Iran, then America. Now I spent years trying to belong to Africa, Malaysia, [[Greece]], India. I got turned down and thrown out, sent to jail, rejected. I dated girls and loved girls and left them. Then suddenly Vietnam happened, and now I'm trying to be a Vietnamese man. This dream grew legs. Plus the pandemic has made me slow down. So it's time to open myself up to emotions. Love. How I actually feel about things. People. Things I actually want to do. Things I like, beyond working. Or, maybe working is all I like. Working and growing and learning. That's fine too. Time to stop hiding. #[[Nature Boy]]
                        - Patty watches all your stories first. She’s kinda how you got here. You cried yourself blind then found Meeshka Bernanke, then realized there’ll always be another. You kept your beard, and you never cried like that again. #me 
                        - specifics
                            - Fear of [[downfall]] and a general insecurity
                                - When I was young I learned about nuclear war from a book.
                                - I cried like crazy when I pricked my finger.
                                - I'm not religious. I think this life is all we got.
                                - Mixed kid, grew up all over the world, tried to fit in everywhere, don't know where I belong.
                            - a feeling of debt
                                - My mother went through hard times for me. I want to show her that I made the most of my life.
                                - My dad never realized his full potential. I want to do it on his behalf.
                            - guilt regarding women which manifests as an urge to please them
                                - My dad never showed love to my mother. Cheated on her. Drank too much. Was gone. She cried to me, a lot. I never wanted to do that to a woman but at the same time I felt like the enemy because I am a boy, I am his son. 
                                - Fell in love with girls who barely knew me, who I barely knew, and cried myself all the way into physical pain.
                                - I would cum from two pumps.
                            - a feeling of not being a man
                                - Raised by my mother
                                - Moved to LA at 13, hyper-masculine society.
                            - too many ideas
                                - Was an only child for a long time.
                                - A writer. A dramatist. 
                            - I attempt to become Superman
                                - I turn into a work machine
                                - I start drinking heavily which allows me to
                                    - make girls cum
                                    - look cool in front of friends
                                    - have fun with girls or in situations that would probably bore me otherwise
                                    - not give a shit when girls leave
                            - but lost myself in the process.
                                - I don't know what I like anymore in terms of
                                    - women and love
                                    - the feelings of sex
                                    - anything that isn't work
                                - [[alcohol]] is the anti-love. It is the opposite. It precludes the need for love. it numbs you to the reality of life and yourself. it pushes into the future every day the day where you take some risks, be brave instead of strong, as Trang says, and but what? see, this is why writing is dangerous. we write too much and confuse ourselves. create shit where there ain't shit. If you're drunk, you can't feel shit, physically or emotionally, and you don't need others. If you want to give and receive love, if you want a lady and a family you have to reduce the drinking and increase the loving. That's it. So sober up. If you sober up and you still don't want the shit, fuck it, forget it. Drink with friends or alone, but not with women. Or very sparingly. You don't even know what or who you enjoy, and you can't as long as you're always plastered. **All of this gets fixed very simply, by bringing that alcohol graph down to zero in the weeks and a low thrum on the weekends.**
                                    - Maybe alcohol numbs me to how boring these women are too. Almost certainly that helps. 
                                    - You drink to deny facts. You drink to pretend you're not soft, a lover, bored with all this. I drink to hide an anxious nature. I drink to suppress emotions. Consequently I don't know what I want. That's why I have to chill out. And who needs love when you got drank?
                            - Another slipped through 
                - A boy has little interest in growing up...
                    - A boy has little interest in growing up. He looks at his definition of a man – his father, and if he can’t be found, then the man whose path he crosses most often – and he doesn’t understand what being him involves, but he knows it’s nothing he wants to understand in a hurry. He has the rest of his life to be him, and today to be a boy; swift to emotion, loving whatever moves him, for as long as it moves him. A boy does not want to be a man until he gets his heart broken.  Heartbreak is (hopefully) a boy’s first lesson in death. Things go wrong. Things end. The biggest, grandest, most beautiful feeling you can imagine can, and will, vanish. There will be times when you have nobody. And one day, time itself will disappear, and so will you. The moment a boy begins to understand all this is the moment he decides he wants to grow up more than anything else. He wants to be a man, because men don’t get their hearts broken. He wants to be a man so nobody can cause him to feel pain like that again.  So the boy spends his young life trying to become his definition of a man. He wants to know that women find him attractive, interesting, that he can give good sex. That he can be the kind of man women cry over, not the kind of man that cries over women. He learns the fast highs: a new phone number, the thrill of a first date, (sexual conquest)   love is too mercurial, too much like lightning in a bottle – it escapes and everyone gets burned, and he’s not in the mood for that. He puts his love into his career, and himself. He builds himself to be big and strong and handsome and successful, all the walls that protect his core, all things that will ensure a steady stream of women admirers so that when one leaves another is on the horizon, until they all blend into one woman. But they admire him; doesn’t mean they understand him. One day he realizes he’s everything he wanted to be: attractive, smart, suave, wise. That he can live without a love. That he can survive, even thrive.   Emotionally, he has become a stranger to himself. It’s desire, wanting someone for yourself and trying to influence outcomes that leads to heartbreak. Expecting a feeling in return. Ownership, when we don’t own anything except this moment. But if we focus on making each moment as good as it can be, that’s as much of a guarantee as you’ll ever get.  Meanwhile, that man is working on becoming that boy again.   Then he meets someone who makes him realizes that’s not enough.  And a man spends his young life trying to prove to himself that he still has a young boy inside of him, that can love and have faith and give his heart freely without worrying about the future.  You’re a man once you embrace love again, no matter the consequences.   That’s just me pinching myself. Because you feel like less of a stranger to me than anyone. If I hadn’t put a little distance, I would have proposed or tried to give you that baby.   
                - __Sally Hewitt__
                    - I had a crush on a girl named Sally. She agreed to be my girlfriend, at which point I avoided her whenever possible until I concocted a story about how I must break up with her because I’m heartbroken over my ex-girlfriend who died in a car crash in Yugoslavia. I remember a girl named Georgina. She had black hair and thick legs and freckles and wore black tights and red Doc Martens. I liked them thick before rap. Another girl named Emily who was darker and gorgeous and smelled good. #women
                - __fuckboy loverboy__
                    - I am __fuckboy loverboy__. My normal designation in this game. A joke, to be abandoned and talked down to by girls who sell cosmetics on Facebook while they sleep in the same bed as their mothers, all because I'm too nice.
                    - The third night was An, the single mother who resurfaced in my DMs. She said she wanted a few glasses of wine and we all know what that means. Nice form fitting black dress and a good heavy ass. Skin smooth and tanned. She's a woman. She spits on my dick. She calls me the best over and over again. I like fucking her. But she said some dumb shit too and got flushed like they all did basically, and all can. Theres gonna be respect around here now. An freely told me the sex was good but she felt nothing else. Why does that bother me? I guess because it’s nice to just have those niceties going. When you lose those you lose me. I like to be liked, and I like to like people. It’s a shame really. She was so smooth, her orgasms so true. But she had something apprehensive, beaten down, cowed about her. 
                    - Ivory Wilson
                    - Anna Bui
                    - 
                - I was way over the top with love. Now I'm way under. __philophobe__
                    - Maybe I took breakups so hard when I was younger because to me they were a form of [[downfall]], failure. A hard stop. A decision. The end of possibilities and imagination with this woman. The story had been written and in this one you were the one who didn't measure up. You never once said "fuck that bitch". You always threw yourself on the side of your assailants, agreed with them in your own inadequacy. #downfall
                    - I like some [[women]] too fast. So I went the opposite, and now they wish for [[Nature Boy]], original James. At least, they say they do. But that's not how I bagged them.
            - [[hand]] | [[screw]] | [[nuclear]]
                - __Shakira's Paradox__
                    - I had love. I gave it up to be a machine. And because she was fat. 
                        - You know your life is a chase of vapors, which would be fine if you had all the time in the world, which you don't. Or at least, girls don't, and in your case, Martha is the girl you're thinking of. In response you normally say "that life is the reason you met me" which would be all fine and good if you stopped searching when you found someone good but you just kept going. Martha is young me, Mikey. You could have been Martha, Mikey, people who stand for something, writers who are publicly writers, or at least put their love out there, not stuff it somewhere to the point that their own mothers have to say "can you show us __anyone__ you date?" and all you can do is shrug. She is a writer. She is putting her life on the line for art and representing. You aren't. You are a cynic. A music sweatshop guy, planning the ultimate cheat in business, music and women. Ball the fuck out so all will be forgiven. Trying to cheat your way into Superman, and see if all the illusions finally become real at some point, satisfy you. #cheats
                        - 20 years ago I gave up [[Nikiya]] for a goal I still haven't hit. it is what it is. and that was real. so why would i give up this goal for anything less? 
                        - Shooting for thick black chicks but settle for stout, and you're fucked. Cut to the moment when you see a borderline man on your couch and you know it's over. #women #Martha #Nikiya #downfall
                - __men want to attract [[women]], not win them__
                    - Na and the birth of [[hand]]. Girls have an infallible way of finding out who's beneath them. They just say nothing, and let us __impostor__s hang ourselves.  #[[Vietnamese girls]] 
                    -  Amitie, a charming host, and the emergence of James, the immovable object. The whole truth and nothing but. And the truth is I want one to keep. They're the liars. #women 
                    - Novita hitting me; it's been years with her. She married a white man. Now he's gone and her child is in another country. Versus [[women]] with no [[screw]], who stay where they belong. Girls who ask "which language will we speak today?" Girls I have to move across the world and learn a fucking new language to fuck. Girls my [[mixed]] ass is __jealous__ of and wants __validation__ from. People who know who they are, even if who they are is about three square inches. They are fine with that. They have no need for all the [[options]].
                    - Wit is for lames. [[Vietnamese girls]] and foreign women in general are extra immune because of the language barrier, and of course all [[killers]] in general because they don't need to deal with it. __Shakira's Paradox__.
                    - Blond Saigon Tran. I literally stopped traffic, a woman craning her neck out the window to stare at me. You think you want the girls who attack you and rip your clothes off. But you can’t control those situations. The shit that gives you a woody is when those legs swing open almost by mistake. Their legs arch up and they know it’s wrong but they can’t refuse. #[[Vietnamese girls]]
                    - Had an interesting conversation with Cheyenne sharpening my usual theory which I explored on Themes. Men don’t want to win a woman through intelligence and wit and charm. That’s like cheating. We just want girls to imagine our heavy dick and swoon. We want them to do it against their best instincts. In women as in music you always have to pull off some mental hijinks to get your audience. Or at least you think you do. Later that week you’d see H on Tinder, and instantly you knew she’d want you. How? All she had was pictures. She looked a bit reserved. Intelligent eyes. Posing in different countries. Not extremely hot so she must have some character. Then you met a girl who gathers new for the Vietnamese media. Instant convo. These are the women you click with. You have to accept it and go that way. 
                    - Someone said don’t manipulate people into your life with wit and charm. Give them a little and let them figure the rest out. #women
                    - Jack Nicholson, the old clapped out player of my [[downfall]]. "If men are honest, everything they do and everywhere they go is for a chance to see [[women]]." Charm as a blunt force weapon.
                    - 
                - __give women what they're not used to__
                    - If she's hot, ignore her. If she's average, go in.
                - __intelligence is a lot more attractive when you aren't__
                - __"I don't care what you like"__
                    - When you tell a woman what kind of body you like she will normally tell you she doesn't care what other people like.
                    - Obviously we can't have the kind of body everyone likes. We have an idea of the kind of body we want (which is normally based on what other people like anyway), and if some people like it, they like it.
                    - But don't pretend like you aren't happy when people like what they see.
                - Going nuclear is just being completely honest in the context of your relationship with this woman. The decision depends on one question: __is this a girl you can take seriously?__
                    - You don't really want to listen to her
                    - You want to jerk off to conversations with her
                    - Practice your Vietnamese with her
                    - And maybe have sex with her at some point.
                    - You're open to being proven wrong, falling in love with her, as always. You just know from experience that it's unlikely.
                - Sex ain't shit. Treat girls you only wanna fuck accordingly. Your best chance.
                - Never blink. Them not liking you never even enters your mind. When they say no, laugh it off, or ignore it completely and keep talking. You don't care either way.
                - Switch between niceties and long disappearances, until the ratio turns your way
                - Talk about yourself much more than normal.
                - If they are average looking, lavish attention on them. If they are hot, do the opposite.
            - [[seen]]
                - I like some [[women]] too fast. So I went the opposite, and now they wish for [[Nature Boy]], original James. At least, they say they do. But that's not how I bagged them.
                    - Reminded of what Fouche told me in her kitchen: “you love too easy”. I was way over the top with love. Now I'm way under. __philophobe__ I'm easy to read apparently. __Nikki Lashae__ said you're __scared__ - "fear informs your moves". #me
                    - Was reminded of my facetime with __Seble__ earlier where she said “you’re kind of a playboy. You say this stuff too easy.” I have been selling so hard to women and clients lately. __chasing__'s what I do. #me #shnub
                    - Bao says I like her too fast, I want a man. Sounded like Fouche but the difference was I don’t like Bao. Probably didn’t like Alexandra either. As soon as that ass disappeared, so did I. __shallow__. #women #downfall
                    - Remembering Mikhail Adams. Really hot girls like Linh Linh and __Nikki Lashae__ who wanna hang out really fast. "You like people fast," in the immortal words of Fouche. But you're actually just __fake__. Pouring words and fake concern into bitches who get perfume headaches and say "to be honest" a lot. #women #[[lừa đảo]]
                    - Bao says I like her too fast, I want a man. Sounded like Fouche but the difference was I don’t like Bao. Probably didn’t like Alexandra either. As soon as that ass disappeared, so did I. __shallow__. #women #downfall
                - [[women]] say you like to kiss a lot. Wonder what that says about other guys. 
                - [[women]] like me because I don't hate them. I never understood how much so many men hate women until I moved to America. 
                - [[women]] remark on my eyes.
                    - A couple coffee dates with a Russian baby mother to a rich Mexican guy who wants his cake and eat it too and apparently he’s getting it all because foreign chicks. Andy’s living. The guys who move confidently towards their idea, the Trumps. Reshaping shit. 
                    - Filthy talk with Linh, the ugly runty one who looks great in pics. She says I have kind eyes, and sometimes sad. Just like mom says, a sadness. But ultimately women like me because I seem kind. It's not rocket science. The memories they repeat are the talks, the days at Starbucks when Jena put her feet in my lap, and I let it all happen.
                - types of girls who like me.
                    - Teachers. Writers. Loners. Not really feeling any connection to an ethnic group.
                    - Girls who want more from life, who are angry.
                    - I gravitate to teachers, writers, creators. Pretty girls who aren’t so pretty that they don’t know the world. Passionate women who don’t take the cruel world lying down. That was actually Fouche fatal flaw: she was too pretty. She wasn’t really on the planet. I normally can’t be in relationships with women who are too good looking. It distracts me. They’re not people to me at that point. I just try to fuck them and don’t pay attention to what they say because they’re normally good looking much more than anything else. But at the same time I can't accept anything less than a dime. So I must become a dime so that the dimes don't faze me anymore. It's the only way. #me love #downfall
                - Filthy talk with girls like Little Linh who see my sadness. #seen
                - I get [[women]] mostly because I'm polite. Nice.
                    - [[Bonny]] crashes, and tells me about myself. She loves me. I slide in Van's DMs and she pats me on the back because she's nice. Bald Rose slides in mine and I do the same. Just a bunch of people enabling each other. God almighty, if not for a well-turned heel. 
                    - I asked Hanh Cigar “why do you like me?” She said “affectionate.” Roxy started liking my pictures and we got into it. She said the same thing. I am affectionate. Some girls like it. #seen
                    - [[how to]] bag [[Vietnamese girls]] when you're white: pay for everything. Most white guys go dutch.
                    - [[Loan]] said "I've never seen you so insecure." I told her I don't know how to let go of things. 
                    - __Thao Elite__, __Ngoc Le__, [[Loan]], Pi and hot [[Vietnamese girls]] with [[fam]] issues who you can actually bag because they aren't ten mentally, and/or have sex with you the first night which you don't even really want then they have the audacity to get weird. I guess they just want a nice guy to whyle out with. And now they're all gone. And I try to make it work, in my way. Put another way, Vietnamese girls who are mad hot and grown because they have no family.
            - [[cheats]]
            - [[love]]
            - [[tinder]]
            - __roleplay__
                - I love sexualizing women because it's so easy to make me cum sometimes. I pretend to be this impenetrable big dick porno guy who just sits around with his legs splayed open dragging women in head first.
                - Calling them baby aka a baby, not my baby on some pedo shit. Just a way to make them less threatening to me.
                - __American Psycho__
                    - My Patrick Bateman side. The anti Nature Boy. They fight. My disinterested pair of legs in the camera while a girl creeps and crawls under them like tripwires on battlefields to suck my dick while i stroke her face and check my phone because I cannot actually pull that shit off unless I'm blind drunk. 
            - [fighters]([[mom]])
                - [[Trang]], still fighting. The [[mom]] of her family.

            - __Coolidge Effect__
            - __women want all of you and then some__
                - [[men]] want their dream of [hypergamy]([[cheats]]) and [[women]] want their dream of monogamy. Everyone would rather chase the dream until they're dead than deal with reality. We're both always looking for solutions to the __Coolidge Effect__. So far they are:
                - At this point I’d rather take Strawberry, who’s plain looking but wants me to teach her how to suck a dick. And when I know that’s what I want, even pretty girls gotta get in line now, because the pretty ain’t the main draw no more. Maybe now plain girls will get some respect around here. When a really really hot girl adds me on FB out of nowhere I give her suspicion, not a tongue to wipe her ass with. And on a Saturday where I’m doing everything right at Starbucks having a long deep conversation with Dylan about this company of ours and Jun walks in, this pretty, tight girl who likes me so much she can’t even pat me correctly. And she’s not hungry when I am so I buy a crappy sandwich just to sit next to her and say nothing when I should be talking to her, learning about her, but all I end up doing is enjoying the sun, which does feel pretty good, then I leave her alone to go and sit alone in an office and delete people and mp3s and songs and lines and ideas and women and countries and futures and dreams. Wanted Africa to accept me and ended up in jail. Wanted to be American and threw all my shit away and left. Now I learn Vietnamese and live in an apartment building with dead fish staring at me in the lobby and wait for the cops to show up to the office or a white person to tell me it’s all over. I got a ways to explaining it. 
                - Sent [[SreyMom]] a picture and she said “still interested in the moment… that’s why I couldn’t keep you.” Still here even after I gave her bumps on her feet. How can they still think I'm a nice guy? #seen
                - then Mai Mai says
                - We like the moment. and there are a limited amount. Women don't necessarily want dumb men but they need someone who will give them lots of moments. Simple. #[[nothing good has to happen]]
                - __Farida__ said I’m smart and she only dates dumb guys. #me #women
                - [[Vietnamese girls]] and how only smart [[women]] can get charmed. 
                - Our office takes shape. I build my studio. [[Vietnamese girls]] want dumb guys.
                - __slutty__ [[bitches]] turn men on, and other obvious shit. The sweet spot to tag a woman and sleep okay at night about it is right in those early stages when your novelty is at a high and she thinks giving you a sample might make you buy the whole cow. 
                - Women picking a dog. I’ll take any dog really, as long as he doesn’t crap on the floor. Women love men until they fuck up. Men and [[women]] on that inverse chart. Men come in numb, women come in gushing. #shnub
                - Phone convo with [[Ngoc]]. She wants more time. She’s gotta go. She’s doing that whole “I’m gonna get what I want from someone” thing, very robotic. Like she will really actually just fall for any guy who irons his pants and shows up twice a week. On the other hand that’s probably better than what I’m offering. But maybe not. Maybe we all need some more realness in our lives. People have needs. #women #[[Vietnamese girls]]
                - They want you, stupid. But they need a man who will stay.
            - __women want a reason to close the door__
            - __women like the truth__
                -  Amitie, a charming host, and the emergence of James, the immovable object. The whole truth and nothing but. And the truth is I want one to keep. They're the liars. #women 
                - Beware [[Vietnamese girls]] and [[women]] in general that are too friendly too fast. I basically prepare these chicks for a lifetime of fake love then present myself as the honest alternative.
                - The Day of 3 Dates. I kick [[Bonny]] out without tea, look at Vietnam war planes and My's mustache, which I should have trimmed with the beard trimmer [[Ngoc]] gives me later. Khanh and Uyen tell me some shit I don't wanna hear and I think about whether honesty is good or just __rude__. #women
                - “my people don’t wake up. They don’t wake up from Pol Pot. Who is going to wake me up? I have to fight for myself, my people, my son.” [[SreyMom]] says she can't walk around with me if I'm leaving then does exactly that.
                - Had a couple beers at Chops then met [[Ngoc]] at O Leary’s. I told her the shpiel. I have to make this work. Then she licked my chin, met me later at home, winked on the way down, and blew water all over my floor. When you put soul into things, people feel it. As opposed to your spam life. #[[The Big Nut]] #[[Vietnamese girls]]
                - Found myself thinking about the words to “Modern Love”. “There’s no sign of life, it’s just the power to charm.” Is that really no sign of life? “But I never wave bye bye,” I never let go. “But I try,” I try to let go. Looked through an old CD box and found [[Bree]]'s Indiana Jones birthday card: “you are my favorite adventure.” And that’s why she had to let you go, because you didn’t want her. #women
                - "It's too late". When you charm [[women]] with no real intention of hanging around you're a __fake__ asshole already. Word to [[Martha]], [[Loan]] and all the other women who say you're the best thing they know and the __philophobe__ still keeps moving on. 
            - __women like standards__
                - starching and ironing
                - water with every drink
                - punctuation
                - Speaking of, Sabrina tells Kenny he's intimidating then says it's a compliment, and I agree. Girls like the moody guy, and they are intrigued by rules - drinking water with beer, using periods at the end of sentences when you chat. 
                - Amitie and the whole truth, nothing but the truth. #women #shnub
                - Phuong558 shows her [[screw]]s.
            - __[[love]] is rare__
                - if you are __insecure__ you should be doing what I do: keep yourself off limits from [[women]]. Don't pretend, lest you force your son to be a husband to his mother and father to his siblings, and possibly you too. Love and secure [[men]], the two rarest things there are. #dad #fam
                - Novita said to me "you traveled through conflict zones for the woman you love." Life gets so busy that we don't have time to look at the fucking obvious. Who has done shit like what you did for love? I can love. When it's time, I show out. #seen #me #Violet
                - Beware [[Vietnamese girls]] and [[women]] in general that are too friendly too fast. I basically prepare these chicks for a lifetime of fake love then present myself as the honest alternative.
                - __[[love]] is rare__. 8 billion people but #women #her
            - __women are a mirror__
            - __everyone wants love, no matter what they say__
                - [[Nature Boy]] ties his shoelaces while his insides tell him there is a thing you haven't swallowed yet, that you can't accept, and until you accept it. things won't budge. #[[The Big Nut]]
                - Beware [[Vietnamese girls]] and [[women]] in general that are too friendly too fast. I basically prepare these chicks for a lifetime of fake love then present myself as the honest alternative.
                - all men want love and family. no matter what they say. they're just working within their options and their limitations. and yours. 
                    - Amitie and the whole truth, nothing but the truth. #women #shnub
            - I don't do balanced relationships with [[women]]. Either she has all the power or I do.
            - __sexting__ __the pump__
            - __when women are extremely friendly out the gate, get ready for the crash__
            - __I've never let a woman feel safe around me__
                - Looking at __Big Muzi__ and Leila, I realize again I've never allowed a [woman]([[women]]) to feel safe around me. I've never had the entirety of a woman. And it's wearing [[Loan]] down. I'm fending Loan off for literally nobody, nobody except the possibility of better [[options]] down the line. __loveless__.
            - __MacGyver macks__
                - The day I rode a bus I didn't even need to down to National to try to mack a girl I saw at a bus stop. #LA #women #shnub
                - Greece to Hanoi [[transit]] with the Orfium boys, trying to bag an Emirates first class flight attendant. Nobody telling you not to use your phone at certain times. People walking around while the plane is taxiing. Turns out these rules aren’t for your safety – they’re to encourage you to upgrade. #1bag #shnub
                - I bag a dime white girl at King's Head and as usual... __I fumble [[killers]]__
                - **The day I tried to mack a chick who works at the Genital Warts clinic**. 
                - I MacGyver mack Devakhi with her date in the bathroom, one of the greats. I've macked chicks out of moving cars, when they were on dates, when I was on dates, straight off the street, whatever.
                - I almost mack a Persian pharmacist up while buying Plan B for another chick. #shnub #women
                - I almost get arrested staking a chick out in Atlanta. #women 
                - Sheilah
                - Fouche
                - __Roxy__
                - Anna Gkika
                - Charmaine
                - Happy salty year and 200k to a MUFG receptionist. [[women]] make me high. A bitch that will scare me. This is what women do to me. [[mom]]'s opinion of me always killed me. Maybe women's opinion of me just kill me in general. #her #flow
            - __men are just babies that their mothers tolerate, then their new [[mom]]s aka their wives__
                - [[dad]] has left Penang. Simon said "where to? I said "who knows". But for now, it's running to his sissy __Woozy__, just like me. Girls take care of family while the men go on pointless romps then when the bubble pops and reality enters, they run to their sissies and mothers (if they are alive) so they can take care of full-grown men too. 
                - [[sajiao]], because [[Vietnamese girls]] know men don't want smart women, and maybe that's why [[Dariush]] and [[dad]] and [[me]] are here in Asia, in this [[mediocre world]] where we don't really belong. #downfall
                - Avoiding [[women]] like our [[mom]]s because it's a love too big, heading straight for [Asian women]([[Vietnamese girls]]). #downfall
                - Women’s implication is always that men are useful idiots, kids who need to be cajoled with carrots and sticks first then indignance to wise up to the world. #women
                - Phim and [[fam]] on Khao San. The saga of the nag. #women
                - Started thinking about the downside of Martha. First of all, I remember looking at her in Penang and telling myself to make a mental note that she’s not it. She is in situations. I remember my relief at getting her on that plane. All the tears. The awkwardness. Getting grilled at the tables outside Monkey Bar. The passive aggressive shit. You love her, but sometimes you just don’t like her. Imagining you finally letting her into your heart and dreams and future ideas, and suddenly I’m explaining myself to her like she’s mom. Just give me a little more time, just trust me. Fuck that all the way to hell and back. I’d go from one mother to another. Everything about me needs to be rehabilitated? Are women really just spending their entire time fixing men? We’re just big fat spoiled babies that need to be calmly and patiently showed the flaw in their entire existence? I think when you really love someone and you’re ready, that conversation becomes almost nonexistent. 
                - Avoiding [[women]] like our [[mom]]s because it's a love too big, heading straight for [Asian women]([[Vietnamese girls]]). #downfall
                - __Hendrie__ calls wives a mother substitute. And maybe I already have a mother figure and I don't need two.
                - They’re all the good in the world and us all the bad. Sometimes I feel like I have to accept that women are patiently trying to save us from ourselves and go with it. Other times I want to scream at her, I don’t want another mother. 
                - In the pool at Timbers playing that old banjo about how (nailed it finally) men are just boys who move from one mother to another. Nice addition: women have one baby, then another baby. But later on the balcony Matt first tells me about his usual errant drinking and cheating father, except he didn’t actually drink that much, and his mother is the one necking bottles of vodka per day. And Alex noting that his mother never wanted to go on holiday trips with him until she saw us doing it. And me looking at Mike and Britt with a little envy, and noticing that these kids are being taken care of. Dad never threw me in the air in a pool. So the takeaways are a) we’re improving b) my woman theory only applies to me and this amazing mother of mine. She poses for pics perfectly because she’s so effortlessly confident. My argument was what do we do for you? Well, in the old days we were actually supposed to bring home the bacon. We don’t necessarily do that anymore. I told them I want to be rich. Which is another way of saying I want to be insulated from the nagging. This is how we do it. I’d basically be a John. And my kids would never know a young me, and my wife wouldn’t really know half of my life either. I’d just be some fully formed guy that shows up. And increasingly I feel like mom and I are the parents here. And everyone sees what has happened. Mom has formed a seal around herself by making it understood that her life is in our hands. Read somewhere where marriage was originally a scheme where a man transfers ownership of his daughter to another man. In my book it means he gets a new mother.  
            - __[[men]] and [[women]], complete inverses__
                - [[women]] are all good, men are all bad, and any amount of one in the other is just the other rubbing off on them. #shnub
                    - [[Sean]] introduces me to the word __philophobe__. But they'd say you're not your Dad, James. You were raised by [[women]]. You know better. But I wanna be a man, my way, and still make it work. For [[dad]]'s legacy.
                - Women picking a dog. I’ll take any dog really, as long as he doesn’t crap on the floor. Women love men until they fuck up. Men and [[women]] on that inverse chart. Men come in numb, women come in gushing. #shnub
            - [[Bree]] and [[women]] who go have their fun then wanna foist themselves on you when they're all clapped up.
                - Thinking about Bree. She could have been the one, back when I was trying to get at her in 2012 and she was younger and her parts worked. But at that time she was snorting coke with her ex so she shined on me, and now that I'm here but she's spent she got the crocodile tears. Now she’s ready but she can’t have kids, and I got shit on my plate. She is good though. A good woman. And I don’t know what it could have been like because she never opened up to me completely. Women never do with me because I’m not safe. So I don’t open up to them either and it’s two ships passing in the night.
            - __I really, really don't want to get divorced__
                - [[dream]]s of [[mom]] going, but more than going, being lonely. This is why I hate broken marriages as much as anything. But if she never got married she'd have been much lonelier.
                - I watch __Seinfeld__, which may have been the first show to point out that marriage doesn't look that great, at the same time as I'm lying alone in this room in this strange place at age 42 as young girls ask me why I'm doing that, and I realize that [[mom]] and [[dad]]'s situation is exactly, precisely what I don't want. Divorce aka a huge failure, and kids that are far away from me. All that togetherness to be alone. Dad is alone so much. It's so sad.
                - __Lisa Colacurcio__ barfs alone over panoramic views of Hong Kong while her ex-husband Armel pounds young poon. Japanese look depressed. High suicide rates, low sex drive. They look it. Meanwhile the subway cops bow up and down like human yo-yos. #characters

        - men don't get dick problems, they just get tired of the same person 
        - [[men]] settle down with [[women]] when fear of being alone overtakes fear of routine, or when they feel sufficiently in charge of the feelings of a woman they care about, but rarely out of desire.

            - My kids will not have the [[ahdoot]]s. Very old grandparents, if at all. It's a shame. #downfall #shnub
                - Woke up one morning thinking about how my kids will not grow up with the Ahdoots. They will be mythical people they hear about, Iranians, and they will have their blood but almost no knowledge of that culture or those beautiful people who I had the privilege to grow up with. 
            - Getting quite [[American]], don't you know. #COVID #shnub
                - Getting guns to protect our land here. We used to just bounce. 
                - [[Iran]]ians get hoodwinked by Landmark, Khomeini, cult leaders, psychologists
                    - The Scientology offshoot of Landmark continues to chew our family up, but I pointed out that Sofi and Sanam wouldn’t be integrated without it, everyone pays therapy eventually in LA, what do you want. Similar thing I said when mom said Afsoon’s hate for Bahram was killing her. Calm down. Talk like this is killing her. Mom called me her wise boy. Says I’m so much like Agajan. We’re the only ones who still have it, huh? Everyone else is drifting. Even Alex now has a phantom 40-year-old brother while his sister runs back to that psycho bald guy who it turns out was stealing money and pills from everyone on that trip. Matt is all us. All he wants to do is eat kaleh pacheh and hang. Alex is warming up. Bought me a little drum machine, made me 1BAG shirts. We all love Michael more and more. I have two brothers and two dads now. Two of the closest girls to me married Jameses. We are solidifying.

My education means I could be considered lower middle class if I clawed my way up into the right kind of society but I never fancied that.__
                    - [[dad]] said: __Grandma__ was very Devon, as is __Woozy__. __Grandpa Tom__ was less so as he had a Cornish burr but his accent softened in the Navy. I spoke noticeable Devon (without being aware of it) until I went to college in London and my fellow students from all over UK thought it was very funny. So I stopped. A Devon accent is regarded as being spoken by slow-witted cider-drinking yokels in smocks sucking on straw twigs. Hence, besides carrot cruncher and swede basher, we are also known as straw dogs (great movie - Sam Peckinpah, Dustin Hoffman, Susan George, set in Cornwall).
                    - [[UK]] and [[Iran]]ian class divisions. Poor but doesn't buy their own furniture. 
                        - Dad said: Iran and the Middle East is all about tribes for identity rather than class. The Ahdoots were Jewish merchants. Class only develops and becomes important when tribes disappear. Like Western Europe. Or the US, which never had settler tribes.
                        - In UK class is about family background, education, proximity to high class/aristocratic bloodlines, and well down the list: money. Nouveau riche is an insult here - new wealth is not respected. A subtle put-down is: "Yes, they have money now but they had to buy their own furniture." Meaning, no 500-year breeding. And in the UK many upper class families are much less wealthy than rich working or middle class families. But they are still high class because they speak with the correct accent. Working classes speak with regional accents, like my family. Upper classes do not.
                - [salesmen]([[ahdoot]])
                    - The [[ahdoot]]s are Jewish Esfahani merchants. Brains, not brawn.
                        - The Ahdoots are Iranians. We come from Esfahan, a city with a long history of Jews. Apparently many Jews consider Esfahan holier than Jerusalem. I’m not religious but I like the fact that we are Jewish. I respect our focus on family, education, entrepreneurship. I respect the Ahdoot talent for surviving with flair, using their brains to flourish, never force.  The Ahdoots were generally salespeople - fashion and textiles – and money lenders. Esfahanis are known for being shrewd businesspeople, maybe a little conniving. 
                        - The Iranian concept of honor, however, differs from its Japanese or even Arab equivalent. The other side of gheyirat is aaberou (face saving). The mechanisms for saving face in Iranian inter-personal discourse usually preclude extreme situations. Loss of face due to an affront to an Iranian's gheyirat usually does not call for extreme reactions such as suicide or murder. For the most part, it is alleviated verbally and does not preclude continued contact between the affronter and the affronted. An analysis of the Iranian tendency towards mistrust and conspiracy theories suggests that arguments in the course of negotiations should be based on clear shortterm incentives and threats, and not on incremental long-term confidence building. Progress will not be made through discussions of the rights and wrongs of each side's view of the issues. Iranian political dynamics will not allow a concession on the basis of the justice of a position. Negotiations must achieve an acceptance by the Iranian side of the brute facts, rather than an understanding of the merits of the other side. Written agreements have more or less the same status as oral ones; they are subject to review when the circumstances that prompted them have changed.
            - [[ahdoot]] [[LA]] days. #Iran
                - [[mom]] used to shout at me while I slept. woke up and she's staring at me holding a dish asking why i'm not a millionaire while [[Shahnaz]] smokes a cigarette on the edge of my bed couch. #shnub #LA
                - Nights were cigarettes and Jose Cuervo shots and arguments and tears and music. #LA #shnub
            - The [[Dunn]]s and the [[ahdoot]]s [[cheats]].
                - __Etti__ and [[Shahnaz]] cheated. Agajan slept with women on the road and according to [[mom]], Mamanjan condoned it. [[Etti]] was mom’s mom. The fairytales unravel. 
                - I think [[dad]] told me __Grandpa Tom__ cheated. __Grandma__ was molested by her piano teacher and had no interest in sex.
            - The [[Dunn]]s and the [[ahdoot]]s. Fire & ice, and that's in me. 
                - [[mom]] and [[dad]], my fire and ice.
                    - [[mom]]. sensitive and open. feminine. my world. made women everything to me. make her proud, feel that it was all worth it.
                    - [[dad]]. writer. drinks to numb himself from the feelings of writing and love which he doesn't have the strength to fulfill. or the desire? my male role model. i just want to be more of a man than him and make him proud too. Don't love me.
                        - went 1bag to find my dad, and become more than him. make him proud.
                    - Their approval is everything to me. I don't just want approval from woman. I went to the ends of the earth to get my dad's approval and i work 24 hours a day and idolize women for mom. guilt. approval, first of mom and dad, then women, then people who overlooked my music, to the point I made a career out of jamming my shit down people's throats, and make it a special point to jam my dick down girls' throats.
                - [My]([[me]]) [British]([[UK]]) side always fought with my [[American]] and [Iranian]([[Iran]]) side when it came time to be big. 
                - Cold [[Dunn]]s.
                    - __Grandpa Tom__'s dad and [[dad]]. Generations of weird [[Dunn]] fathers, then [[me]], breaking the cycle. 
                        - __Grandpa Tom__'s [[dad]] Ernest walked out for the newspaper one day and went to Australia and nobody ever saw or heard from him again. #shnub #1bag #fam #Dunn
                        - Apparently when [[dad]] turned ten,__Grandpa Tom__ drove him out to Dartmoor and left him there to find his way home. A growing up exercise, apparently. 
                        - __Grandpa Tom__ never told [[dad]] he loved him, who never told me or [[mom]] that. 
                        - __Grandpa Tom__ kicked [[dad]] out at 18. Dad never got over that. Dad used to tell [[mom]] to kick me out too, and I only got his respect when I left home.
                        - [[dad]] didn't go to __Grandpa Tom__'s funeral. Said screw him, basically.
                    - __Grandma__ apologized to [[mom]] for [[dad]] when they divorced.
                    - __Woozy__'s only memories of affection between the two was when __Grandma__ lit __Grandpa Tom__’s cigarette when he was driving.
                    - ((0gi8nvlm3) [[Dunn]])'s true colors, and the weirdo Ashley family.
                        - John Ashley was a weird old school kind of father who went ballistic if dinner wasn't ready and that kind of thing. And now everyone in the family hates each other. Figures.
                        - As the years go by, Kerry reveals herself to be the empty, petty, money-grubbing woman I always had a mild hunch she was. Apparently she had bad middle child syndrome, resented dad for being the boy and Wooz for being the last daughter. 
                        - The __Ross__ vs __Woozy__debacle.
                - Meanwhile __Haroun__ and __Dolat__ [[ahdoot]] were famous for actually being in love.
            - [[Mikey]] told me Nobody knew the love I knew. I wanted to earn the family’s love. Our love is driving the white people crazy. Mike, Lisa, Mary, all jealous of us. The love too big.  #ahdoot #me #fam
                - Avoiding [[women]] like our [[mom]]s because it's a love too big, heading straight for [Asian women]([[Vietnamese girls]]). #downfall
                - Took a picture of [[mom]] I know I’ll keep forever. __emo__ next to the love too big. Word to [[Mikey]]
                - Understanding of [[Nature Boy]]'s dynamic with [[mom]] developing.
            - __Ashraph__ breaks the [[ahdoot]]s.
                - The Ahdoots lived in a Muslim part of town which was unusual for Jews back then. My aunt Ashraph married a Muslim man and the local Jews shunned our family so badly that the whole family moved to Tehran. They say it’s a big reason we’re generally not as pious as most Iranian Jewish families.
                - They used to find __Dolat__ hiding in closets. She became a sad and worried woman after __Ashraph__, even more than she already was.
            - How [[dad]] bagged [[mom]] - aka how an English teacher bagged an Asian chick - and how that movement affects [[me]] to this day. 
                - My mother saw how the Jewish community had ruined the family over Ashraph’s marriage and told herself she’d never marry a Jew. She was looking for a way out of the life that seemed to be all she could expect. She went to live with an English family in England as an exchange student in the mid-70s. She met my dad in a pub. They started going out then she head he had another woman so she dropped him, then went back to Iran. He flew there and showed up on the Ahdoot family doorstep out of nowhere. She tells me she wasn’t particularly into him. He was weird. Not very loving or sexual or passionate. But he was smart and interesting and he was a way out of that life. They moved to Tehran together. Dad’s friends from England showed up – notably Simon, who would soon marry mom’s friend Flo. They met in England when dad met mom as dad and Simon were best friends as were mom and Flo. These were the days of the Shah’s reign over Iran, when it was apparently a wonderful place to be, like Europe in the Middle East. I grew up with photos of dad and mom and a bunch of straggly hippie friends partying shirtless in their Tehran flat. Looked like great days, the kind I wanted too. Mom and dad traveled the world together for a few years. India, Goa in particular, New Zealand, Australia, southeast Asia and more. How can anyone grow up looking at those and go live a normal life? They’re family people on both sides. I have success and money and fame in mind. Almost none of them did. They had family and taking care of that family on their mind. Every day is what are we eating, when are we picking up so-and-so, oh no so-and-so is sick, internal squabbles. 
                - I’m like my parents; I wanted to go somewhere else. We thought there’d be places where life is better. Or at least we wanted to know what the world was. Difference is, I was brought to America, where I could be all I can be. And I think I’m trying to be. And I’m in a generation that marries less and later. I’m still pre-occupied with sex and success, which suggests insecurity. My family carries a lot of melancholy because they had a country and loved it and it got taken from them and now they live on the other side of the world in Section 8 housing surrounded by people they can’t communicate with. The thing they went through made me feel tough by proxy. Similarly I developed a melancholy about anything I could; death, leaving places, the pain my family feels. And in the moments where I can actually put together some self-pity without feeling like a total fraud, it’s the quickest path to tears. Martha says I used to get this look after being at her house like I feel bad because I haven’t worked and reading that put a lump in my throat. It’s self-pity. But in the realest sense. I actually look down on myself for it. Not a rewarding self-pity, but the real thing. Me feeling sad for myself, that I’m the kind of person who can’t even allow myself to enjoy things because I think that’s being grown. I never forgot how lucky I was to be able-bodied and male and relatively white and not from a completely broke family and living in all these places and then finally Los Angeles when the rest of my family was in Iran or cowshit England. So I work. 
            - [[Dariush]] & [[dad]]: [my]([[me]]) two male role models.
            - [[mom]] said "we're all in a deep sleep".
                - Apparently Carol, __Sanam__, [[Sofi]] and [[Judith are in Landmark now. [[mom]] said __Carol__ is just now realizing she doesn’t like to do anything, and facing up to the fact that she never loved __Mohsen__. Mom says she’s worried Franky is doing the same with Alex. Mom said “we’re all in a deep sleep.” Got me thinking. Don’t we just go from one deep sleep to another? What’s the bravest thing I could do right now? Say that Dunn Deal is a waste of my one life? That music is just me enabling my own mopey navel-gazing instincts? That I get no pleasure out of alcohol and chasing ass? Just falling in love and writing? Giving up the chase for something that can’t be attained? Then what happens? I wake up and realize THAT was all bullcrap? Like Dad says… life is about variety. 
                  
            - [[Iran]]ians get hoodwinked by Landmark, Khomeini, cult leaders, psychologists
                - David told me about how __Mahvash__ actually went to Ithaca because she follows some dead cult leader who told her the world will end and she wanted to be there when it happened because she had a beautiful moment there with some wildlife or some shit. Sounds like some Landmark shit. You think you know your [[fam]] then they tell you they’ll kill themselves in ten years, or your aunt actually moved east to follow some cult leader. #ahdoot #characters

                - Why men like Trump.
                    - Men are __insecure__. And Trump is the most insecure of them all. Poster boy for insecurity. Operating from that place of insecurity, trying to satisfy a hole that can't be filled, and he'll burn everything down instead. It's a man thing, why guys relate to him.
                    - In the end, it's tribal - him and the entire American thing right now. White people are getting the lip. Men are getting the lip. So here comes a white guy ready to shout back. And white men will go down with him no matter what he does.
                        - And Brexit is exactly the same. How lame can old white guys around the world be to look at Brexit and Trump and realize they all bought the same tribal bullshit? Trump not conceding without blowing the place up is a microcosm of Anglo Brit and Americans who can't accept that it's over without doing their best to fuck us one last time.
                - The troll president.
                    - Came with the "up is down" bullshit
                    - indirectly cribbing hard from the Russian playbook. Make people question facts, question democracy.
                - retard rights
                    - Black, women, gay and now __Trump__ is the poster boy for retard rights. And Putin for dictator rights. Why can't megalomaniacs trample the world like American presidents? #westVeast

            - I think I learned quantitative easing. The government prints money to buy shit from big companies who put that money into their accounts at the Fed. Which seems to be why stocks are hot while the average American not so much. #shnub
            - The Japanese and Germans lost WW2, and both like getting crapped on their chests. Coincidence? #shnub
            - Cancel culture is intellectual terrorism. The oppressed’s blunt tool of warfare. Nobody plays from the same position. Why should we pretend? #shnub

                - HOW DANGEROUS IS IT? 
                    - Crime but also diseases, murderous mosquitoes, snakes, spiders, car crashes, anything that can kill you. Is it safe for women? A lot of women are particularly unsafe in certain countries. Is it a country where everyone rides motorbikes? Motorbikes are dangerous even when you’re NOT in a foreign country and drunk half the time. White folks are getting squelched every day out here on bikes.
                      
                - HOW CHEAP IS IT? 
                    - What’s the cost of a beer? A decent room? Supermarkets? Flights? 
                      
                - WHERE ARE THE BEST 
                    - cities/beaches/bars/local beers/neighborhoods/local condoms etc.
                      
                - WHAT’S THE VISA SITUATION? 
                    - Getting a visa is a different story in every country. Do you get your visa on arrival or must you apply beforehand? How? How much does it cost? If you’re from [insert country here] how does that affect things? 
                      
                - WHAT ARE BASIC PHRASES? 
                    - A lot of countries have English as a second language. But a lot don’t. Basic phrases everyone needs are how are you? Thank you! Left. Right. Stop. Yes. No. etc…
                      
                - WHAT ARE THE WEIRD LOCAL LAWS TO BE AWARE OF? 
                    - For instance, Vietnamese law forbids foreigners from bringing local girls to their hotel rooms unless they’re married to them (which is why I use AirBNB). African countries will lock you up if you take a picture anywhere near their government buildings. So on. 
                      
                - WHAT ARE SCAMS TO WATCH OUT FOR? 
                    - Bangkok obviously is swarming with ladyboys. Any Indian man trying to shake your hand will hold on to it, “read your palm”, then demand $30. So on.
                      
                - WHAT’S THE POLITICAL SITUATION?

                    - [[Vietnamese girls]] on bikes. Unbearably gorgeous, every day, how do you expect us to be with just one? Seriously.
                        - casually to the side, one shoe dangling.
                        - alone, little butt holding onto seat, back arched, knees knocked, exclamation mark expression permanent, receptionist uniform and glasses. [[Vietnamese girls]] live in the spreadeagled and squat position. slinging the fruits of all their sex under their arms. It's kinda hot. Something sexy about them squatting around digging through trash. Eating and fucking machines. Ugly and yours. That pic of [[Loan]] drawing on the wall of that coffeeshop was sexy, because she's so talented but it counts for nothing here. She will always need a man to really get her out of this mess and she knows it. And that's why she frowns in that picture like she's giving birth. Vietnamese women are still old school women. You can feel in control.  
                            - So many of them. They all look the same. Driving around with their legs open and their babies hanging off them. Hard to talk to them. They're down to fuck. So they're just like vaginas on wheels. You can order them like food delivery and take them all out at the same time.
                    - [[Vietnamese girls]] do a few squats and think they run shit. Eirlys Pham and the amazing returning [[Vietnamese girls]] whose asses I kiss because they do a few squats and now they think their shit doesn't stink.
                    - how to order pho or the most interesting Vietnamese food to order.

                - Boredom and the weirdness of too much sex and a normie life, an American life of Valiums and cleaning under the fridge.
                    - Fred Neil, "The Dolphins", he left the race of the [[darvish]] to lock himself away like [[dad]] and me here in this __loveless__ [[1bag]] life. Charlie Sheen, looking like a young me, staring into the abyss of downfall. [[Dariush]] and Chrissie and the ordinariness of life and being __dreamer__s who can't accept life, which is to say __death__, particularly the death of [[mom]], and how all this sex, this hole in us is what keeps it all going. 
                    - Fuck. I'm a normie again.
                    - I discover __Hunter's Paradox__, and I discover that a lot of people don't like art that pokes fun at them. #1bag is a mockery of the average lifestyle. #[[The Big Nut]]
                    - Back to that feeling: my inevitable [[downfall]] and showing up late to a normal life. The biggest of my worries. 
                - Gen Xers are apparently struggling to get jobs. Everyone who's not me is struggling. Am I struggling? Did I do it right? I mean, aren't you supposed to own your own shit by middle age?
                    - I learned a lot from my father. He just said, you know, if I'm making less, fuck it. Eventually, you know, what it gives you in peace of mind is more important. My moms couldn't understand it, you know, but then later on she did. But that move taught me a lot. It just showed me that business is the only way to go. I don't care if I'm making $10 on my own, it's better than getting $100 from somewhere and you don't know where it's coming from.
                - Reading about the impending dollar collapse, thinking about how I'm holding onto my money, doing nothing with it, thinking about how [[Dariush]] lost everything. Walking into this office and looking at BassTeam shuffling in here every day for what? Do they think they're gonna get rich with us? But it's just a world full of people, and according to modern life they all gotta do something. They need a reason to live. So they build shit nobody needs. And I write and create all this crap that by the rate of progress will never come out.

                - I would probably gladly work until late hours every night if I had such a place. That workspace is goofy.
                - I genuinely don't want to go to Charcoal. Don't want to drink. Don't want to spend. Do want to use this time and get ahead. But I also don't want to wind down a weekend all cold in a dark place with my mother behind me, or alone somewhere.

                - [[why]] am I here? Why do I even want to be here? #Vietnam #1bag
                    - Being around the unfortunate assuages your white guilt. From the hood to the third world. Robin Hood. 
                - Duh. You broke up, went nuts over love and bounced.
                - The kind of people we tend to be. 
                - Realized if nothing else, I want surprises. I want to go out not knowing what's going to happen. #1bag
                - #writing #1bag #downfall
                    - [[why]] [writers]([[writing]]) like __Fitzgerald__, __Bukowski__, __Greene__ and __Orwell__ go #1bag - the main motive for “non-attachment” is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work. [[cheats]]. #women
                    - December 2020, [[Hanoi]]. "living an exhilarating life of thoughts and ideas, the romance of the unusual". __Hemingway__ #Madoff #1bag #flow #Hanoi “I had observed that the men who were most in life, who were molding life, who were life itself, ate little, slept little, owned little or nothing. They had no illusions about duty... or the preservation of the State. They were interested in truth and in truth alone. They recognized only one kind of activity - creation.” Just what I was writing about today.
                      ~ Henry Miller  #smimooz
                - Music. 
                - I'm just trying to stay where I belong. in [[transit]]. my whole life has been that. the [[mixed]] people and places and spaces. #smimooz
                    - I grew up loving lots of places and the people in them and now I just rotate between those people and places. or I read stories about somewhere nd I want to live the story. 
                    - nobody has ever known what I do for real. or where I am. or anything. girlfriend, nothing. anything you go all in on will consume you. you're on the slide. I want to be able to walk. I want to be truly unique. 
                    - published in southern times? Malaysia. la times. I need all this shit. 
                - Make money with people
                - experience the real shit. My army.
                    - Jon Kim. Came up tough Korean-American, cops killed his dad after he beat his mom up. Marine, doctor, astronaut. Says army saved his life. #1bag is my army. getting in, and getting out. Really ain't shit though. __self-pity__ in deluxe hotel rooms, getting too sleepy to continue thinking around 5pm. Kinda lame. 
                    - Lucky/panic mode. [[walkabout]] through [[Hanoi]]. Nobody does all I do. Getting angry and it's good. Washing your dishes at a million miles an hour, angry at dishes. Reminds me now of that Simpsons episode where it turns out Ned Flanders is a __fake__, so angry he can't see straight. At the Chinese border sniffing orchids. __Davey__ and [[Mikey]] visit [[Vietnam]]. The [[ahdoot]] anger. #fam #Iran #shnub #flow #Hanoi
                    - __Nick Tynes__. __I haven't lived__. #1bag #shnub #Cambodia #characters
                - [[Etti]] loses __Albert__. #1bag life: No criticism. No aging. Just [[cheats]] that end in the first act. Everything is new, every day, in a world of strangers. Listening to "Lucky" by Radiohead. __I'm on a roll / I feel my luck has changed.__ Because that's 1bag life: No criticism. No aging. Just endless resets that end in the first act. Everything is new, every day, in a world of strangers. Now I must make it to the second act. #fam
                  
            - 1bag philosophy
                - [[why]] [I]([[me]]) did #1bag - to be about something.
                - Let me explain my situation. Long story short, I threw everything
                  away and left LA in 2012.. recorded albums all over the world for a few years
                  before landing in Vietnam, where I have a bunch of social media and marketing nutbags who are gonna help me properly drop all this music and footage I’ve accumulated through all the traveling under 1bag which is the name of this whole project in general. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EInf5YDsn8&index=1&list=PLgCPyKgMaDj6YhBXVY5AaVGMYOFs8Wxjk
                - Give people a foolproof method to figure that out. Rap Bourdain eats beats across Africa, Asia. Sharpen the shpiel above to bullets. Age, gender, location, interests. They’re basically just like you. Mixed up. Your music is personal. So they should be like you. The world is tilting to minimalism, travel, aging western world and hiphop market. Genre is often secondary to brand. 1BAG is the brand: a homeless traveling rapper, who gave up everything and everyone to understand the world, roam like VS Naipaul, see the world through cultural masks, and record, write, shoot, and document the world the journey. I’m a writer journalist traveler of rappers. World’s most interesting person. Your core demo may be travel types. Yea i dipped for 4 years. Got deported arrested. Traveling, grown, worldly. middle-aged, worldly, agnostic, minimal, mixed, immigrant, traveler. Cheap connoisseurs. No islands. Flexibility in life and view. 1bag shares this journey in the form of rap albums recorded in different countries, music videos shot the same, Instagram article/photo combos that will soon become long-form pieces and books, the 1BAG web show, and clothing.
                - life is enough for [[me]]. Living is my talent. #smimooz
                    - I dream of just being in Bangkok and then I realize that in a way I am simple, in the sense that life is enough for me. Observation. I don’t need wild shit. Some men want to watch the world burn. Some men just want to watch the world. Some people wanna rock the boat. Some people wanna watch the waves. 
                    - Lank Spengler at 43 has had two kids, two wives, been cheated on, lost his dad and his job. The fuck have I been doing? Oh yeah, seeing the fucking world. __Nick Tynes__. __I haven't lived__. #1bag #shnub #Cambodia #characters
                - Cultural astronaut. Always looking for home. Forget about home. Realized where I’m from. Not LA or anywhere else. I’m from the road. I am james bond. Mazzi said I look like a British assassin. Mol posts the same pic of me and people call me the world’s most interesting man. 
                - Wow. I am not funny. Or interesting. 1BAG Greece is a fucking snooze. I sound like a little boy. And as a rapper, forget about it.
                - Minimalism. financial freedom/escape. budget traveling. Reality show of a permanent traveler. Your Zapp repost story goes. Write about shit people care about. Keywords. What is the actual difference between 1BAG and The Unfamiliar? 1BAG would be more of a structured lifestyle of traveling approach. The Unfamiliar would be total wildcards. Experimental writing. Guest posts. One or both of the sites would use your pics. 
                    - The Unfamiliar topics seem like the kind of things you toss into 1BAG stories as asides. They aren’t illuminating enough to survive on their own. 1BAG is muscular, action as character. The Unfamiliar is just another rant. 
                        - Scandinavia analogy wouldn’t be an article. It would be a cutie you toss in. Articles full of sharp cutesies – the true points of the article masquerading under cover of something absurd, because that’s what life is. 
                        - I always had an idea for articles that were pics unrelated to my story, kinda like NYer. Unique, nobody else could write them. Draw from this well. You don’t even have to think about it. The only issue is it would suck your entire life down the tubes. 
            - Real-time payments.
                - [[Vietnam]] is no longer such a place where I want to fit in, and more of a runway. Patience. Everything you throw in a closet will bounce out. Every knife you pull will almost stab you. Every top comes off hard. Everything you touch needs fixing. Every top you lay down whirs to a stop. But everything is paid for on the spot. You don't pay huge at the end. You pay every day and you can walk away anytime.
                - Money and words and lives get lost in translation. Money is never just money, especially when it’s more than a little. Everyone wants their cut. At least I pay for my life upfront. I pay for a car in uber-sized increments. I pay my insurance and groceries and gym in weekly increments. My relationships in bite-sized advances. #Madoff
                - If we Americans, like Namibians, had to pay for power and cellphone airtime upfront and had no access to credit cards, we'd be living in trees.
                - In the third world you pay for everything in real time. Pollution. Bills. Not that different. In all ways the system is more naked here. But everything is paid for on the spot. You don't pay huge at the end. You pay every day and you can walk away anytime.
                - Maybe life in the old days was like life now in the third world. You pay the piper in daily increments. Everyday pain of finding money today to keep the lights on, but no credit, so what you find, you keep. You're clean. As opposed to [[COVID]] times where you live on this big borrowed bubble that explodes all over you one day.
            - self-preservation
                - A black South African named Jay died in a bike accident, piss drunk, 5am, on the wrong lane of a bridge. Realized my favorite people out here don't ride bikes. #Vietnam
                - Avoid photo shoots, especially in front of government buildings. #1bag #shnub
                - I don’t actually take many risks. 
                - Yes, I do feel like a bitch a lot. I don’t ride bikes. Don’t like heights. What else? 
            - beyond stats
                - yes but WHY is Vietnam unfriendly or sa dangerous? If you don’t explain then they just look crazy. These people fought the French, Chinese and americans. This place should be a shitheap. 
                - Took Herb Imperial for chicken and pancakes. Boring NYC guy in Atlanta with a failing hiphop internet channel. Why did I order the chicken and pancakes? I couldn’t even taste it. I rarely taste food. And when I do, so what? I’m not even into taste like that. It comes and goes. And leaves me bloated and fat and broke and with this cholesterol, possibly dead. And why did I eat the pork chop Alex gave me later when Frank guilted me and mom into going over there for a drink since Frank’s been complaining that he’s been moody? I don’t feel so bad about that one. It was free. Had a shot and a beer and got outta there. Felt my liver tweak almost immediately. Decided to take BTC and studio edits day by day. Sean and Sum sound like they’re getting me in the studio. Was extremely close to going to Don Antonio for tacos and beer when mom hit me with that good rice. Spent late night talking lowkey filth to Kurejea who’s as retarded as ever. Simi is back. Spent a while catching up on her tweets, part procrastination and part interested in her like always. A girl pushing. Appreciates Carl Sagan’s eyes and Drake. Has that young African pretty privileged bullheadedness but I guess I represent the end of the line of that kind of thinking for her, and she taught me a thing or two during this fight we’re just now getting out of. Statistics should be accompanied by WHY these stats are so high so that there is context. Nothing I didn’t know before. I was just talking about how it’s a combo of stats and the stories of everyone I know who ever visited South Africa that make me say it’s a dangerous place, even more loudly when South Africans seek to fight that so hard. At some point there needs to be personal accountability. But what do I give a shit. Went through BTC, came up with a list of things to do, and was in bed by 10:30pm. This plan is working so far. Woke up, walked to coffee while pep talking IKP. Tamped work down then got into music. Listened to PreBoarding to make sure I don’t suck, especially after Ka. No. It’s so good! Got angry at the world for a bit, then used the anger. OP3 is at the wrong pitch. Victory’s chorus needs splicing with the mp3. But Phill’s new snare for It’s Okay is good. Realized I’m going to record as much as possible next week, and squeeze work mercilessly. Long as the socials and interviews are rolling, very few of my current clients are entitled to expect anything more. And at my current rate of work I should be in decent shape. Chisel away at the rock like water. Calm and steady.
                  
            - expat stereotypes by region
                - Al Eberhardt, the most classic old white git [[Thailand]] has ever seen. "Forever searching". Sounds familiar. #1bag #shnub #characters
                - __Da Nang Shawn__
                -  __Tom__, lost in #1bag life.
                - __scared__, __fast__ guys to to Asia. Big strong ones go to South America.
            - vietnamibia. polar opposites. SADC vs SEASIA. #1bag  #Namibia #Vietnam
            - google translate dates with Tam Huyen.  #1bag #shnub #[[Vietnamese girls]]
            - expat quality. when are you just a loser?
                - I'm not [[Nature Boy]], I'm just __scared__. And that's why I'm in __limbo__, surrounded by losers, and slowly becoming a __loser__ too. I need to bust my ass, get some [[hand]], and move on to my destiny.
                - Al Eberhardt, the most classic old white git [[Thailand]] has ever seen. "Forever searching". Sounds familiar. #1bag #shnub #characters
                - [[killers]] literally gets me out of bed. I could just relax and go broad crazy if it gets to that. Do what people actually come here to do.
                - __Orwell__ talked about how the only thing he knew for sure is that he would fail, and it gave him a resolve to survive so at least he could live on his own terms, go somewhere where he could fail in style. #downfall
                - [[darrell]], Teddy and Linh Linh new guy. You're doing okay out here. Can't shit where you eat and expect a good meal.  #Hanoi #women
                - Darren, the __emo__ Brit who drives around Tay Ho in the same suit with the same pin cushions on his back when he's not crying in public. __Moondogg__ the [[American]] said Brits are "emotional", not even being a dick, just a genuine observation, almost confused. #UK #characters
                - [[Cambodia]] is shortchanging itself. $50 [[visa]]s that last a year. They darned my pants for a buck. Mentioned this to [[Rob]] then it occurred to me that he’s only surviving here because it’s so damn cheap. #1bag #shnub
                - The [[Cambodia]]n Retirement Plan. #characters
                - [[Rob]], Kampot [[characters]], kinda loserish, and here you are. Some old guy named Stan had a kidney infection and they had to bust his door down. The Turkish chick Stam had a bad bike accident, currently in hospital. Nick got jackknifed; you know the story. Even Rob got bitten on the ass by a dog and needed rabies shots. #1bag #shnub
                - Andrew Gruner, go away.
                - [[politics]] with a bunch of clapped-out expat degenerates. Reminds me of leaving Wells. Fuck this place. #Cambodia
                - Pity the ex-pats. Not the locals.
                - it's not like saudi expats getting booted. [[Vietnam]] attracted the borderline homeless
            - People's ability, no, determination to __halfass__ and ignore the elephant. #Madoff
                - [[Cambodia]]ns and the weird amnesia of post-genocidal peoples
                - Namibians in an AIDS and woman killing epidemic
            - Talking [[politics]] overseas
                - You normally end up doing so with ex-pats. And they normally have very antiquated ideas of their home countries because they've been guzzling beers in a lungi the last 20 years, and are ex-oil people.
            - People who are their race first. #mixed #politics
            - discuss your 1bag loved songs
            - the alienation of a #1bag life
                - A lame [[walkabout]] day in [[Hanoi]] makes it plain: I must learn Vietnamese. #Hanoi
                -  __Tom__, lost in #1bag life.
                - Early morning chat with [[Dex]], who has also fallen out with [[Sum]]. Glad it ain't just me. I hung up as old ladies in conical hats walked through the park in front of my house, and I thought about how much these falling outs brought me here, to this weird place, alone. #[[crew]]
                - [[Etti]] loses __Albert__. #1bag life: No criticism. No aging. Just [[cheats]] that end in the first act. Everything is new, every day, in a world of strangers. Listening to "Lucky" by Radiohead. __I'm on a roll / I feel my luck has changed.__ Because that's 1bag life: No criticism. No aging. Just endless resets that end in the first act. Everything is new, every day, in a world of strangers. Now I must make it to the second act. #fam
                - Watching __SATC__. Their end of an era, and mine. End of my calm little [[Kauai]] life of jogging down the coastline. Playing "Satellite Of Love" and realizing I'm the satellite. I wander between all these people, then I cry in their garages.  [[COVID]] may have shut the door on the allure of the 1BAG life, a life of drinking cheap beers in inconsequential situations. I don't have to stand around alone in weird places, stuck in one spot because going left makes as little sense as going right. The only reason I would do that now is because I'd be lonely, and the only reason I'd get lonely is if I continue to live like I was living, like life isn't real and serious. The world is like a man with a woman. When the world gets sick the world panics and throws hail marys. What the world doesn't realize is that it's always at death's door. Big got sick and immediately he called Carrie, like I do. And the second he got better he went back to his fantasy life, but men can do it forever, which is cruel in a way. Nothing to make them hustle, no urgency. And then one day the shot clock runs out.  #[[nothing good has to happen]] #[[The Big Nut]]
                - The [[Vietnam]] dream: fighting to keep something you might not actually want.  #1bag
                - [[Madoff]] starts thinking about exactly [[why]] he is trying so hard to fit in here, married to someone I can barely understand. __jealous__ of people in their own skin. #1bag #mixed #visa
                - I get [[Galdj]]'s girl a glass of water at breakfast buffet. Jneiro Jarel has a stroke in Costa Rica. I imagined dying in that hotel room or even just having a stroke. Who would come to get me? An album named Nobody To Get You Off The Floor. 
                - How #1bag lives tend to end. [[me]], half [[dad]] half [[Dariush]]. 
                - going native
                    - [[Hanoi]] probably isn’t for me. Why would it be? How adaptable do I think I am? I deserve more than being in a neighborhood where nobody understands how to talk to me or who I am. #1bag
                - The invisible man. When you're everywhere, you're nowhere sometimes. #options #1bag #why
                    - Novita and a quiet Lebanese restaurant. We had several of those quiet moments when you have nothing else to talk about because this relationship is going nowhere. We can’t talk about the future because we have no future. We just have jokes and drinks and maybe some fuck. #1bag #women 
                - Looked at that park full of Vietnamese from behind the thin curtain; the lone foreigner, who doesn’t leave the house except for women or money, while a community, life, togetherness happens in front of him. If you stay here, you learn Vietnamese. That’s it. #Vietnam #1bag #shnub
                - [[bye]] Hanoi for a while. I'm nobody at home and nobody here, I'm trying and failing to do too much, and Vietnam won't even let me do that. Walked outside and saw a pretty hot Vietnamese girl who looked familiar. But she was probably just very Vietnamese. Meanwhile fucking Otherwize posts your lyrics while girls fall asleep beating your door down here. You just have too many [[options]] and you're a __dreamer__,
                - Outlook is fucking up. Called Godaddy. Internet dropped my call. Called on mobile minutes. T-Mobile won’t connect. Posted on a forum. Forum says I’m spam. It’s a wonderful life. Pushed through on the folder access problem and it seems like I actually fixed it. And it only took me almost a day. Getting up the following morning I realize I’ve spent almost 20 hours in here, on nothing. But consider that Diane Poremsky lady. 30 years spent on Outlook. That’s commitment. Outlook has given me just about everything I have. I should probably show some respect, and accept the fact that it requires upkeep. Yesterday was all about patience. The closest I got to the things I wanted to say to Judy were “I’m trying to be cool here.” 
                - waking up one day and realizing you actually have no connection to your home anymore.
                    - Sat on the bus thinking about how maybe one day LA will not be my town. When the [[ahdoot]]s die and I’m already gone and I don’t really put much effort into my friends… nothing lasts forever. Devon is about to shrink in my life. Places where you once had people start to fade off the map. Between my grandparents dying and the family feud between my two aunts, I only have a handful of people left in England. In ten or twenty years when the majority of my mom’s siblings are gone, I’ll still have people in LA, but not so many, and if I’m still not living back here by then, how much will they really care about me? #fam #1bag
            - weird routes, 2nd tier cities. Flight path king. Quite dashing straight outta central casting / packing #asking #1bag #kickers#transit#me #transit #borders
                - My cities of expertise: [[LA]], [[NoLa]], [[ATL]], [[NY]], Windhoek, [[Penang]] and [[Hanoi]]. #1bag #shnub
                - Dad walked by. This is a stronghold of mine now. The new shirt would be [[NoLa]], [Kampot]([[Cambodia]]), [[Hanoi]]. All French towns. I’m proud. 
                - learn your world history and save
                    - flights from colonies to crown countries
                - how different routes feel. #1bag
                    - __Phu Quoc__ to [Kampot]([[Cambodia]]) for Tet - the land speed record. My usual MO, just breezing towards a pretty complicated situation with a big lack of seriousness. Did this whole trip thinking to myself how amazing this is, and I am, and nobody will ever be able to share in these memories with me, but then this could easily be a horrible trip with someone else around, or a great trip full of sex and fun. Who knows. Fuck it.  #1bag #borders #transit
            - [[American]]s and [[Vietnam]]ese can get dumb about [[politics]] online just the same. How expats and locals start to hate each other.
            - 4 day trip is the perfect length. Or is it? 
            - Amir dies. Part of #1bag is running away from the realities of life. Constant distractions.
                - [[dad]] and __Trump__. Dad blinked. Writing about myself is cool to write, uncomfortable to read, probably a circle jerk. My guess is dad doesn't dare do this.
                - [[why]] [writers]([[writing]]) like __Fitzgerald__, __Bukowski__, __Greene__ and __Orwell__ go #1bag - the main motive for “non-attachment” is a desire to escape from the pain of living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work. [[cheats]]. #women
                - Rolled out in full Pastel Playboy steez to pick up Gateaux Quynh. As far as __death__, "we die. Simple." I told her I can't marry a girl with a thin face. She immediately replied "I have a thin face". I think about it with every girl I swipe on: could she be [[her]]? Then I put her in a taxi, and I walked on back into 1bag, through my balmy neighborhood of Vietnamese women in conical hats strolling bicycles full of exotic fruits past men with gigantic growths covering one eye, back into the world of perpetual motion where I think I can cheat death and age because I don't have to look each day at one of the scariest things in my world: my mother's face getting older. Do you have to accept life? You're gonna die anyway. What does accepting it mean? Maybe it means taking the position that externals like success and alcohol and even a woman can't calm you down. You can keep running and it will keep you fit and sexy and smart and accomplished, but you will run from one empty room to another, and nobody will know you. It's like when I used to play Spiderman as a kid. How can I keep moving but out of sight? 
                - Dad and I are both emotional men exploiting [[1bag]]'s [[cheats]] loophole. Aging together is a mirror and a window of __death__ we want no parts of.
                - __Bahram Ravaghi__ and men dying alone in strange places. Living in __childish__ delusions, like Linh Linh could ever happen. How the [[cheats]] tend to end. And the women that suffer silently. Conversations with [[Afsoon]] and [[Rojeanne]]. #fam #downfall #dad #1bag
                - Hai Pham108 says [[bye]]. Sometimes we make mistakes knowingly, because we feel we have enough life momentum to distract us from our mistakes. #Martha
                - [[Etti]] loses __Albert__. #1bag life: No criticism. No aging. Just [[cheats]] that end in the first act. Everything is new, every day, in a world of strangers. Listening to "Lucky" by Radiohead. __I'm on a roll / I feel my luck has changed.__ Because that's 1bag life: No criticism. No aging. Just endless resets that end in the first act. Everything is new, every day, in a world of strangers. Now I must make it to the second act. #fam
                - Watching __SATC__. Their end of an era, and mine. End of my calm little [[Kauai]] life of jogging down the coastline. Playing "Satellite Of Love" and realizing I'm the satellite. I wander between all these people, then I cry in their garages.  [[COVID]] may have shut the door on the allure of the 1BAG life, a life of drinking cheap beers in inconsequential situations. I don't have to stand around alone in weird places, stuck in one spot because going left makes as little sense as going right. The only reason I would do that now is because I'd be lonely, and the only reason I'd get lonely is if I continue to live like I was living, like life isn't real and serious. The world is like a man with a woman. When the world gets sick the world panics and throws hail marys. What the world doesn't realize is that it's always at death's door. Big got sick and immediately he called Carrie, like I do. And the second he got better he went back to his fantasy life, but men can do it forever, which is cruel in a way. Nothing to make them hustle, no urgency. And then one day the shot clock runs out.  #[[nothing good has to happen]] #[[The Big Nut]]
                - Basil and Manuel, [[dad]] and [[Dariush]]. Why not be [British]([[UK]])? Farce, satire. Scared men who work like a frenzy to run away, create distractions to their last moment. VS __Hendrie__, Scorsese, __OCD__, guys who worked for a week to get a ripping sound right. John worked to find the right branch to beat that car with. John Cleese said he was asked if he enjoyed Fawlty Towers, and he said there was no time to. You should have no time to think about loneliness. 
                - Martha Nussbaum says philosophy is a way to avoid experiencing emotions for yourself. Turns it into a science experiment, metric vs inches, [[dad]] kind of talk, __Sopranos__ pretend therapy, Harry. Men write letters when they can't tell [[women]] the truth. #shnub  #writing
                - I float my plan about going total #1bag to [[mom]] and she swiftly reduces me to __childish__ and sulking in the corner. Is 1bag a form of giving up? #why
                - I continue to insist on __hiding__ from [[mom]] and all the people who love me.
                - Chatted with __Olga__ at home. She’s like me: has the dream situation traveling the world but she’s alone. #1bag
            - don't haggle. always tip. Cheap tourists. Want to save 30 cents, but no problem with a 14 beer. 
                - Did good concise shopping then got suckered into buying oranges outside off some peasant lady with the sad face. The second I acquiesced they were shoveling huge handfuls into a bag. I barked at her and she kept going! Ngoc later said that should have been 30k. Whatever. As much as we get raped in America, I’ll let a poor Vietnamese lady take a couple bucks off top. #1bag #shnub #[[lừa đảo]]
                - Little __Carasso__. An ugly little shit who makes a ton of money and can kick your ass. He told us three men on the street in Mumbai walked up to him asking what he was at about 3am. He gave them $50. He could have beat the crap out of all three of them but he just laughed and paid. #downfall #shnub
                - I walked past the guys sitting around in the street in front of our villa who were stopping cars with a long branch and pushing for ‘donations’. They asked me. I said “for what?” They laughed nervously. The taxi lady said “they don’t mind.” I said “neither do I, but what is it for?” Later I realized I was being a prick. Bad form, old chap. #1bag #shnub
            - How much do I hate, loathe immigration [[visa]] people. Let me count the ways.
                - Similarly, when I see Vietnamese people laughing in comment sections at foreigners who have to go home it's almost heartening to know that America doesn't own the ranch on fucking prick pieces of shit.
                - Son and Anita. Visa bitches.
                    - visa agents who take your expired visa and disappear and now you have no visa, no passport and no way to get any help.
            - Many (asian) wives are just prostitutes playing the long game. Husband, sugar daddy, normally not a lot of difference. __women want all of you and then some__ #[[lừa đảo]] #sajiao
                - [[Vietnamese girls]] on [[tinder]] will ask you what you're looking for on this app. At this point they could 50/50 be a good girl or a prostitute. Not sure what the difference is effectively anymore.
                - God bless 'em. [[Vietnamese girls]] are not supposed to be sleeping around, much less with foreigners. But lots of them are more western than they care to admit now. They're like us. They want their cake and eat it too. That's why love curdles so fast. They think they can meet us halfway. Throw us the pussy then we bow down. Because pussy's all they have. The life of a slave is all they have to offer. That's why this shit is so interesting. Because it's like they don't even know.
                - __Kneipe Carl__ had a beautiful tall hot wife who was his partner in the bar and most things, it seemed. He was my paragon of Old Guy In Asia Getting It And Then Some. Then one day she just wigged out and cut her bangs and asked for a divorce. That's that Asian shit. Say nothing then flip.
                - Sugar daddy vs husband vs.. daddy. Is there a difference? __men are just babies that their mothers tolerate, then their new [[mom]]s aka their wives__ Many (asian) wives are just prostitutes playing the long game. Husband, sugar daddy, normally not a lot of difference. __women want all of you and then some__ #[[lừa đảo]] #sajiao, and many are just trying to get hitched and get out of here.. and what's the difference. Bottom line is if you're an old farang who wants kids, you need a young wife.
                - Marrying [[Vietnamese girls]]: the copout.
                - Being __torn__ with [[Bonny]] and [[Loan]]. [[Vietnamese girls]] marrying rich fats for strategy, [[mixed]] boy gets the dregs. Thoughts on two [[steadies]] in two days: [[women]] can be a drag. #her
                - [[darrell]], Teddy and Linh Linh new guy. You're doing okay out here. Can't shit where you eat and expect a good meal.  #Hanoi #women
                - Reading __Orwell__ you realize the simple woman, normally the foreign woman, definitely the Vietnamese girls but probably even the asian man too, is simple and straightforward maybe because she's focused on the only things that can be hers. Food, kids, this moment, this chuckle. #screw
                - [[mom]]-type [[women]]. 3rd World women who wanna pretend they can be 1st, have their cake and eat it. 
                    - [[why]] the old world frowns on worldliness. It makes you __insecure__. The world is too big. Too many [[options]] and you cannot do it all, as you may be about to find out. You realize how small you are. How can you be anything but insecure in this world once you understand how big it is? Hard to come back from that. Pandora's box leads to __Shakira's Paradox__. A [[Vietnamese girls]] Tinder bio says "I wish I could be a fool. That's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."  “[I]f for a moment we got anything like an adequate idea of [the suffering in the world] … and we really guided our actions by it, then surely we would annihilate the planet if we could.” #shnub #writing
                    - The Tay Ho Killer(s) vs Linh Linh, Hai Pham108, [[Nga]] and the girls whose meat's gone bad and will never understand me but still want the respect, same story as mine. #[[Vietnamese girls]] #[[Tam]]
                    - Tay Ho. Linh Linh. Bullet dodged. [[Vietnamese girls]] with too many bodies.
                    - I got the yoga teacher, the pole dance teacher, the coffee shop owner. The ones who went to Norway and Austria and got banged out by European exes. The ones who used to walk behind Eastern European guys here in their own city. I watched mindless young bops use their phones to take pictures of each other, then their drinks, then just use their phones. I watched young [[Vietnamese girls]] prepping to be old Vietnamese women, sitting in the back. I thought about how sexy I find people who just belong somewhere. I get the fishes out of water, the moms, the Violets, the fighters, the ones who see something wrong with how they're treated as women in these countries but also are gonna do something about it, probably screw themselves out of anything normal in the process. __Shakira's Paradox__ [[women]], looking for [[cheats]].
                - Asked [[dad]] if I’m supposed to marry an Asian. He said he did. And he has no regrets, he’s a lucky guy. He just didn’t know they’d change after marriage and want all your money and wouldn’t want to travel anymore. I said How can you not know that? Even I know that. #women
                - [[Madoff]] starts thinking about exactly [[why]] he is trying so hard to fit in here, married to someone I can barely understand. __jealous__ of people in their own skin. #1bag #mixed #visa
                - My [[dad]] is exactly the English teacher the Vietnamese hate because they’re party boys, and my [[mom]] is an Asian woman who married white guys to get away from them. Never looked at it like that. And here I am. #me
                - [[sajiao]], because [[Vietnamese girls]] know men don't want smart women, and maybe that's why [[Dariush]] and [[dad]] and [[me]] are here in Asia, in this [[mediocre world]] where we don't really belong. #downfall
                - Yoko conceives [[Everything Is Fish]]. Good feelings curdle fast in Vietnam. Fun and pleasantness is a bargaining chip. And if they don’t receive value, fast, they’re out. [[Vietnamese girls]] #writing
                - Avoiding [[women]] like our [[mom]]s because it's a love too big, heading straight for [Asian women]([[Vietnamese girls]]). #downfall
                -  I told [[Rob]] he got the classic Southeast Asian okey doke and he took it. 
                - European exes
                - [[Cambodia]]n [[women]] are the hottest in Asia. I laugh loud at Oh Neals and I know [[SreyMom]] likes it and she mentioned it. I forgot our chemistry. She says “man” like I do and laughs when I curse and likes to bite me and squeeze me and poke me. She wears leopard g-strings like a cross between Tia Carrera, a 2 Live Crew stripper and Heather Deep, all three of my jerkoff fantasies, and deepthroats me with massage oils while my dick does nothing.
                - __Yanti__ returned to cry about how she’s lonely with no boyfriend. She wants a western man but she can’t even spell the word western. 
                - I Fabreze Selena's cum off my bed then rescue Devianti from a rapey Algerian Couchsurfing host and paw at beauty. Classic Asian tour guide chick who's actually an opportunist in the end. Her little brother died in her arms of constipation. She almost died from a ruptured appendix. Her grandmother used to steal rice grains or something to feed the family. Her dad was Hindu, then Catholic, and so was she, depending on how marriageable it would make her down the line. 
                - __Kwan__ aka Asian con girls who pretend to cry on video chat. #1bag #women #shnub #[[lừa đảo]]
                - Came up with the theory that Penang [[women]] are unattractive because of their diets and because they are basically Chinese so as such don’t really belong in the sun and it’s beating them down. Asked dad why he thought they were all ugly and he wasn’t interested in the subject. I guess that’s encouraging in a way. #1bag
                - When I got off the train I proclaimed that the average [[Vietnamese girls]] is better looking than the average Thai girl. And it made sense. You don’t compare hot girls of different ethnicities – they’re already hot. The average Vietnamese girl has cute chubby cheeks and burgundy hair and great lips. The girls I was looking at on my way out of Suvarnabhumi had manly noses, craggy faces, braces, straggly hair. But by the end of it, it was damn near no contest. Thai women are darker, thicker, sexier. 
                    - I realize now: the average [[Vietnamese girls]] is better looking than the average Thai girl, but good looking Thai girls beat good looking Vietnamese girls. 
                - Camelia with Chi Chi where I can't even get a beer. Nothing deflates the white ego in Asia faster than a girl telling you how hot you are then you sitting there while she tells some fat slob the same shit. #[[Vietnamese girls]] #1bag #women 
            - **Asia** is excess everything. #1bag The life can wreck you if you let it.
                - Small dicks. Small pussies. Small money. Small world. Asia makes __loser__ [[American]] [[men]] feel big. #1bag
                - Asia ain't changed. It's an endless wonderland of women and exoticness and it will pull you in and at best, send you old chasing your tail or at worst you will completely wreck yourself, unless you grab a hold of yourself and remember why you're here. #1bag
                    - [[killers]] literally gets me out of bed. I could just relax and go broad crazy if it gets to that. Do what people actually come here to do.
                - [[Vietnam]] makes too much shit.
                - Asia: kids and big kids
            - The Muslim and [[India]]n obsession with sex. #politics #1bag #women #shnub
                - Muslim black Pacman ghost walks in with slob of husband; always depressing. 
                - Tried to sleep. Didn’t really happen. Everyone was ready to go out for the night as I was looking at eight minutes left and I started panicking a bit. They left and I said I’d catch up. Before I even made it out I was getting news of the fallout: Rojeanne and Matt had an argument and split ways, mom has diarrhea and is coming home. Ran into mom on the way out, she seemed alright. Grabbed Rojeanne from Starbucks, where a creepy man was apparently trying to sit next to her. Matt got mad because Rojeanne wasn’t paying attention to him looking at restaurants. [[Franky]] and Alex were sitting at a whisky bar outside. [[Alex]] ran off to find Matt, so it was Dunn time. “Time for you to talk shit about white people time,” Alex said. And eventually, after a few drinks, I started in on Frank, who started crying, which killed me. She swears everything is great, so Rojeanne and I instantly went into backpedaling mode. I also tried to even things out by tearing myself down with the truth, which is that I don’t have the balls to do what my little sisters are doing. The truth really is that she’s my little sister, and if I see someone acting like a prick I’m gonna feel some kinda way about it. Alex and Matt returned but Matt broke off pretty quickly. I took them to Halab, that restaurant that exploded last year, and they loved it.

            - filter to what's good before filtering out what's bad. that's much rarer. basically always look on the bright side of life or death
            - after a certain point, you are responsible for what happens to you.
            - you can change your life this second. you can go somewhere nobody knows you and succeed.
            - have something to fucking do that you fucking like or at least makes you feel like you matter.
            - writers don't do anything about life except write about it. __Hunter's Paradox__ #writing
                - the point in writing the same thing over and over a million times? do something. change your situation
            - DJs are supposed to get a party going
                - why wouldn't shimmy and dwyck be in your sureshots. they are wild fun party songs and that's what you need ok hand. 
                    - actual dance songs
                    - played doesn't matter maybe. they could work in the right juxtaposition 
                    - and what's the dwyck sample
            - salespeople are supposed to sell. 
            - [[men]] are allowed to be men.
                - [[Vietnam]]ese [[communism]] has given its people some clear advantages. Fuck what you heard. The phenomenon of 'liberated' westerners being around traditional people - these are real [[men]] and [[women]], not us. It's not [[hate]], little boy, it's just that father shit you never got. #shnub #westVeast 
                    - very confident people bother [[me]]. They are normally smart and strong and focused and they can see I'm not. I think [[mixed]] people have this issue. When I say I'm __insecure__ people from one country don't get it. They don't know the scope of the world and how you can get lost in it. UPDATE: It's that they are comfortable in their traditional roles. The men are men. They have kids and wives. The women are women. They want men, not me. Looking at all these Scandinavian gayboys we're doing PR for, it's a miracle I'm not gay. But I'm close. I don't understand pain or life and that's why I don't get the hot ones, and why I feel inferior around the guys - because they are men.  
                    - Women normally cry about this more, because they come out here and nobody wants to fuck them. More overlooked is the effect it can have on men.
                    - [[Vietnam]]ese troll on Reddit, obviously intelligent and deliberately mangling English to disrespect it. If he assessed me he'd say I'm a white lefty loser who floated around the world licking my own ass until you fell into a stroke of luck, some Vietnamese scamsters who took you under their wing. You have no leg to stand on.
                    - Imagine walking around your whole life in a funk because you're not a completely irresistible billionaire who's never gonna die, and his mother neither. How insane is that.
            - if everyone says you're hard on yourself, you probably are.
                - __Nocturnal Ron__ joins [[Anthony]], __Daliet__, [[Justin]], [[Askia]], [[Sean]] and all my other friends who fell out with me because they got too high. I know something about __loyalty__ after all.
                    - Ron's been messaging me a lot lately. I remember him now. A weirdly in-touch guy for someone who can be such a prick. But maybe he's not a prick. Maybe he just has healthy self-esteem and knows how to set boundaries and not blame himself for things. I left him a message telling him I love him which is precisely why I need to know why he dropped me like a bag of turnips lo those years ago. He said that hurt his heart. None gave him a brick of hash, he was doing ecstasy, kidney problems, mid-life crisis, bla bla bla. 
                    - Imagining how I'll get around to telling Ron my story. I imagine walking through the alleys of Hanoi bumping "4th Chamber", and I'm the kind of guy that makes sense for. My life is exotic and crazy.I like that.
            - your girlfriend is supposed to turn you on. 
            - rappers are supposed to rap. 
            - Doing one thing and breathing is more than enough multitasking. turn everything off.
            - Life is supposed to be fun. 
            - People get shit to lose, and often lose it. And sometimes get it back.
            - It's not an adventure if it's not scary.
            - Life is hard.
            - people are supposed to die. 
            - almost none of this lasts. it's all about what it does for you in the moment. the futility of it all? what a genie.
                - [[Etti]] at the nursing home. She just talks about __Dolat__, and about handsome men. __Dadash__ did the same. Randy [[ahdoot]]s, or maybe that's all there is. 
                - Looking at these pictures and asking myself, what did I do with all these good looks? Pictures? Girls? Experiences? Music? Even the albums that came out? What are they all worth? What is their result? The end result of the Ahdoots was people. 
                - [[bitches]] are a dead end.
                - the music, the videos, the pictures.
            - in large part, we are who we are.
                - how much is money and success really gonna fix me? what kind of an animal do I wanna be, or am capable of being?
            - exercise is supposed to make you stronger, not put you in the hospital. #health
                - I'm so impressionable. As soon as I read Lifting doesn’t usually build functional muscle. It often makes you inflexible and limits your mobility and muscles aren’t trained to do anything specific. research how to work out in a way that helps your body, not turns it into a coiled spring of trouble that only makes the gym industry rich, I'm on my yoga shit. Because I need to figure my shoulder out, figure out a new routine, and don't wanna hurt myself more until I do. Because of what she said, it's true. Because I think people should know their body and their natural imbalances before they run the risk of throwing themselves in the hospital just so they can look sexy for strangers. Because yoga is functional muscle. Because focus and breathing is everything and that's what yoga does for me. Because yoga helps tinnitus #health
            - one mission is not supposed to take your whole life. 
            - you can't do it all at once.
            - If you wanna do anything greatly, it's a fulltime gig, but grown life itself is a fulltime gig. it's a long slope down at minimum, and it can easily get fucking terrible. 
                - 2 Arms 1 Head, Clayton Schwartz
                - Suicide is damn easy to comprehend. life can easily put you in a no-win situation. Comprehending why __Ali__ did it, less so. I wrote on my dating profiles last week "life can be so messed up. And I've been so lucky."

                        - Ten years ago, a radical spine cancer surgery simultaneously saved my life and disabled me.
                          I had been a very active person, but after surgery, my legs were partially paralyzed. Initially, I leaned on stories of fellow athletes who overcame significant physical handicaps to do their thing again; paralyzed mountain bikers, prosthesis-wearing climbers, blind marathoners, each adapting to achieve milestones in their arenas.
                          But lately, I draw inspiration from an old man with a round tummy who didn’t get out of bed much. I find myself consumed with the later years of Henri Matisse, an artist his friend and rival Pablo Picasso dubbed “a magician.” Matisse wasn’t simply vital at the painful, disabled end of his life — he saved the best for last, enjoying the most productive, creative and revolutionary years of his artistic life, despite being mostly sedentary because of complications that made it difficult to stand at his easel.
                          Matisse’s solution was deceptively simple: reams of painted paper in a range of colors, large tailor’s shears and a dexterous hand.

                          Opinion: I have recurring memory lapses. Is it dementia?
                          June 28, 2024
                          When the Museum of Modern Art in New York announced a show of Matisse’s cutouts, its curators called the event a “celebration.” All of this work had come during the years after the cancer surgery, a period Matisse called his “second life.” The show is the last time for several years to see his signature “Swimming Pool,” a joyous, room-ringing masterpiece enjoyed by generations and soon to be deinstalled for preservation.
                          I live in the Boston area, and though I’d seen the cutouts once, many years ago, I felt like I might need to see them again.
                          Matisse was in his 70s when he had his operation for stomach cancer in 1941. He hoped to get a few more years, he told his doctors. He got 13, working vigorously almost until the day he died in 1954.
                          His extended cutout period started with a single white swallow, made to cover a stain at his family’s home in Paris. Within days came numerous spirited sea creatures and marine flora, spread across the drab brown walls of multiple rooms. He worked through the night — not unusual given his severe insomnia — asking his nurses to pass him sheets of paper and then, at his direction, to clamber up walls to pin the figures into place.
                          A few years later, he explained that because his poor health required him to remain often in bed, “I have made a little garden all around me where I can walk. … There are leaves, fruits, a bird.”
                          He prepared like an athlete. A phalanx of day and night nurses, a masseuse, a homeopath and a team of doctors all helped to make sure Matisse was ready for the next day’s performance. If he couldn’t get out of his wrought iron bed, the bed was moved, using wheels to transport him from room to room.

                          The Impressionists weren’t just making soft-focus dorm posters. Their vision was radical
                          Sept. 20, 2024
                          In December 2014, I drove to New York City with my brother and mother to see the original, much larger exhibition of Matisse’s cutouts at MoMA. It was a family pilgrimage, a kind of tribute to my recently deceased father, a beloved painter and teacher on Massachusetts’ Cape Ann whose colorist works and expressive philosophy was heavily influenced by Matisse. My brothers and I had grown up with Matisse. Our dad’s limited signed print of the cutout “The Flowing Hair,” a variation of the “Blue Nudes” series, hung on our walls.
                          I was unexpectedly emotional seeing the 100 cutouts. At the time, I was two days from having my radical spine cancer surgery. Through months of radiation, I had been suffering from searing pain and often I would seize up, unable to move a muscle because the slightest twitch was agonizing. In my state, just traveling to the Matisse show was ridiculous, but as I saw his mural seascapes such as “Oceania, the Sea” and his sensuous “Blue Nudes,” I felt a lightness I hadn’t experienced in months.
                          I expected to fully recover from my surgery. When I didn’t, I began to come back to Matisse. How had he done his uplifting cutouts when he did? How had he expanded his buoyant vision when so many others would lose their way?
                          When Matisse created his mural-sized “Creole Dancer” in 1950, he wrote to his art dealer son Pierre that he couldn’t bear to sell it to him because he was sure he wouldn’t do something so good again. Instead, he produced many more masterpieces. His ailments slowed him down, but when making his cutouts, he was full speed, likening himself to a juggler or acrobat, the feeling of cutting into bright color akin to flying.
                          Like Matisse, I now mostly use a wheelchair, and my cancer’s recent activity will require new experimental treatments and more adaptations.
                          But, as I hoped, seeing his large cutouts in December brought me somewhere else. The magnificent 11-foot-tall, star-showering stained glass window, “Nuit de Noël,” of which I once hung a postcard in my hospital room, was the first work I saw entering the Matisse gallery. And the immersive “Swimming Pool” reminded me how the same balletic scene lifted him as he composed it across his own home walls in Nice. I remembered Matisse’s statement: “Only what I created after my illness constitutes my real self: free, liberated.”
                          When I left the exhibition, I had an unexpected thought: Maybe you don’t need to be a magician to have a second life.
                    - old roadies
                        - Funny place, the music business — it devours the young and ignores the old. Or at least that’s how it may appear. Aside from a handful of entrenched executives and a circuit of legacy acts, employment opportunities in the industry for those of AARP age might seem slim. But there’s a fascinating exception: Many of the industry’s most respected and consistently employed roadies, instrument techs and live sound people are well into their 60s and even 70s.
                          They’re the sound checkers who puff and count into microphones; the runners in black who bring guitars out between songs; the daredevils who climb into the rafters to adjust lights; the spelunkers who burrow under stages to tweak cables. Their job is to create a seamless experience for the music fan and a painless experience for the musician. They keep the live music industry humming, and their ranks might contain more Medicare-eligible employees than any other segment of the music business.
                          Kevin Dugan, 70, has been working with the onetime Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony since Jimmy Carter was president. Dallas Schoo, 71, has been in the business for 52 years and has served as the Edge’s guitar tech since U2 was playing clubs and ballrooms (he’s been moonlighting with Bruce Springsteen). Betty Cantor-Jackson, 76, first worked a soundboard for the Grateful Dead in 1968, and she’s still doing plenty of local gigs in the Bay Area. “We don’t always have to fade away, you know,” Cantor-Jackson said. “I’ll do this until I can’t crawl in there.”
                          To the musicians who hire them, these seniors are often preferable to younger and less road-tested techs and sound people. “I haven’t filled out a job application in 50 years,” said Frank Gallagher, 77, who is still working on a Las Vegas residency for the B-52’s, which continues in April. (When he started live mixing the Talking Heads in 1977, he had already been in the business for 11 years.) “Somebody asked me for a résumé the other day,” he said. “I said, just ask anybody I’ve worked with, you know?”

                          Danny Goldberg, the veteran music manager and label executive, said these roles entail a remarkably personal relationship with the artist. “It’s like having a doctor — you want somebody who knows you intimately. It’s a huge advantage to the artist to have continuity, and you don’t want to start with somebody new if you don’t have to,” he said. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Right?”
                          Anthony, the bassist, agreed: “Kevin Dugan has been working with me for 43 years,” he said. “With that kind of experience, I can go up onstage every night and feel totally relaxed and confident that he has everything handled.”
                          AFTER 10:30 A.M. on a Saturday morning in mid-October, Bob Czaykowski, known as Nitebob, exited a Quality Inn in Seekonk, Mass., and climbed into the shotgun seat of the 12-passenger Sprinter van that took him and the band Lez Zeppelin to their next gig. He had a full day of stair climbing, road-case lifting, line checking, microphone placing, outlet testing, drum-carpet laying and sound checking ahead of him.
                          Czaykowski, 74, was delighted at finally feeling nearly 100 percent after two knee joint replacements. He would be doing the same things he has been doing for the last half-century that day: making strange, wondrous, louche and loud bands sound as brilliantly strange, wondrous, louche and loud as they possibly can.
                          Czaykowski is perhaps one of the most famous people on his side of the business. Virtually every working tech reacts to his name with awe, as do many musicians, young and old. Czaykowski did “front of house” — that’s the formal name for the person behind the knobs at the soundboard — in the early and mid-1970s for the New York Dolls, the Stooges, Aerosmith and others; more recently he was the close associate and guitar tech for Steely Dan’s co-leader Walter Becker. For the last 13 years, Czaykowski has primarily manned the board for Lez Zeppelin, the all-women Led Zeppelin cover band.

                          “He just wants to be on the road and mixing a band and hanging out with the band,” said Lez Zeppelin’s guitarist, Steph Payne. “That’s what a road warrior is, when you’re excited to get on the road, no matter what. You either dig it or you don’t,” she added. “Bob can get into a van, a Sprinter, a bus, whatever it is, sit there with the rest of us for six hours. There’s never any kind of cranky, ‘Oh my God, I didn’t sleep.’ He never complains about that. He’s just built for the road.”
                          A good tech’s work is mostly invisible to the audience. “People go, ‘Wow, what an awesome show, man. They played 90 minutes!’ But you have no idea what it takes to make these 90 minutes,” said Ingo Marte, who has worked with hard rock bands like Danzig, Saxon and Armored Saint for 41 years. (He’s a relatively young 65.) “I had actually a really bad heart attack like eight years ago,” he added, “and that’s when I thought, OK, I am done. No more touring. But I picked myself up and I’m still at it.”
                          Schoo’s work with the Edge involves maintaining and tuning as many as 27 guitars a night, as well as precisely finessing the mind-boggling array of effects the musician uses, in real time, to build his sound. Schoo said that U2’s residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas in 2023 was particularly arduous.
                          “There are 17 steps from the floor — where my guitar world is — up to that stage. So, I was 70 years old at the time, and I am running up and down and up and down those steps with an eight-pound guitar, for 40 shows. I get paid handsomely for that, but I’m always thinking, when will I trip? Is tonight the night I fall down those stairs?”
                          He added: “I say a prayer every night, I really do. I ask, please help all these machines. Please let my command of them work, not for me and not even for the Edge, but for these 30,000 fans. Let it work for them. They deserve that, they want to hear this great act and these great songs.”
                          Like Schoo, Lorne Wheaton, known as Gump, has been closely associated with one musician: Neil Peart of Rush, who died in 2020. After 50 years in the industry, Schoo recently retired, at 69; his last big drum tech gig was the long Kiss farewell tour. But it’s a “loose” retirement; he retains his membership in IATSE (the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees), and still does local theater and corporate gigs in his native Toronto.

                          Could he have ever imagined he’d work as a tech for half a century? “No, never,” Wheaton said. “I didn’t think I’d live to 69. Let’s be honest here. You’d never really think that you’re going to hit 70 and actually retire out of this business, because it does take quite a bit of savings to do that.” He said that working freelance is a constant hustle, and the wear and tear of aging sometimes leads to unexpected consequences: “You do not want to pass away in your bus bunk or in a hotel room.”
                          Knee and hip issues seem especially endemic in the tech industry, because of the constant need to lift heavy equipment and climb up and down endless stairs. And road workers also have to deal with a schedule that occupies them from midmorning until after midnight. Recently, Dugan, who has been working with Anthony since the early days of Van Halen, informed his boss (who now tours regularly with Sammy Hagar and Joe Satriani) that he was thinking of slowing down.
                          “When I first told Michael that I wanted to get off the road, he said, ‘I’m not going to do that, why should you? I’m still going to be out there,’” Dugan said. “And I said, ‘Michael, are you trying to compare your day to my day?’” He explained how his work begins at 8:30 a.m. and wraps at 2 a.m. “‘You come out and do the show,’” he recalled saying. “‘You leave in a limo, go back to the five-star hotel, or go back to a private jet way and fly home. Your day and my day are worlds apart.’”
                          A road warrior of a certain age working 14-hour days has to make certain adjustments. “I’ve pulled way back on drinking on the road,” Dugan said. “I cannot fathom working with a hangover. I did that for a lot of years. And when you’re middle-aged, you can bounce back from a hangover, but now it takes too long.”
                          There are relatively fewer senior women working on the road because it was extremely rare for women to get work as techs before the late 1980s. (There were, however, many female studio engineers and producers, and many venues are managed by women.)

                          One notable exception is Betty Cantor-Jackson, who began working with the Grateful Dead in 1968, and the Family Dog two years earlier. She is a legend in the Dead community, and recorded the band multiple times in since-released performances that have come to be known as “The Betty Boards.” She continues to work gigs in the San Francisco area, and went on the road with Chris Robinson in the last decade.
                          “The road is kind of a normal. I spent so much of my life on the road, you already know how to deal with it,” she said. “I’m the old woman on the bus with all the boys. I got my bunk, I’m good.”
                          With the exception of Wheaton, not one of these road techs has any plans to retire. “I may be 74, but the funny thing is, there’s always someone older,” Czaykowski said. “That’s because the more experience you have, the better shows you can get. When people have confidence and they trust you, that’s like one less thing that they have to cloud their brain. I know this guy will do the job, ’cause he’s done that same job for me 700 times before.”

Iranian negotiators tend to accept frequent crisis as part of the negotiation process and seem relatively unconcerned by the prospect that such tactics may endanger the post-negotiation relationship. Insinuated threats, bluffing, and disinformation are all highly acceptable. Accordingly, the Iranian negotiator may not only be not offended by the use of these techniques by his foreign interlocutor, but may even hold a grudging admiration for the cleverness of his protagonist. One approach differentiates Persian individualism from its Western counterpart in that the former lacks an emphasis on personal integrity and the worth of the individual and determines that the Persian tends to think of himself and his family first, then of his large kinship group or tribe and lastly of his nation.

                - Gateaux Quynh said we die, we die. Something I can't fathom. So I'm going to sit in my house for weeks, tell mom to do the same, but she won't. She will fly back to LA on a toxic flight and go see her sick husband, and eventually I will go out too because this is life. This has always been the bargain. Milano said you're scared to live your life. And she's right. You don't even want to get on a bike. #[[Vietnamese girls]]
                - On the train to Athens Airport I realized my life should be no surprise. When you were a kid all you wanted to do was get out of your head and live because you never know when it's gonna end. As many people and places and ideas as possible. As many everything as possible. This is what it looks like. This is what you knew it would look like. Everywhere and nowhere, living out of mind, hiding your love, built tough guy image everyone sees through and a few take pity on you. In a constant flurry and daze. Trade depression for distraction.
                - On that Sunday I said out loud “I am going to die. I, James [[Dunn]], am going to die.” I still don’t understand it. I still feel the same. And that’s because I’ve never been sick and nobody I know has every been sick. In half a lifetime, nothing has come along to pop my bubble. I know life is an evil horrible fragment in time but through some miracle I have made it through half my life without having to swallow that pill. So the only think I can feel is gratitude, for my family, my health, me, who is apparently not like most of the rest, I’m something different. Who has been more lucky than us? Not too rich, not poor. Young looking. Quyen said “young mother” and she did look good, better than I expected. Mom said I looked good and I do. This article says we should prepare for death, so when it comes we can relax with it. Why? It’s coming regardless. That’s one thing that’s almost comforting. We are not special. I am going to die but so is everyone else. On the scale of things everyone goes through I’ve had it so fucking good. The best way I see to prepare for death is to live my ass off, and I’m fucking doing that.

                - __Bukowski__: "You can't fight, you can't fuck."

            - __aloof__
                - Phora wears his heart on his sleeve. He's moving forward. I'm still watching Truong barf. Listening intently to people while they speak a completely foreign language and basically ignore me. Thinking about my [[Shakira]] argument too. I'm just a salty character. It is what it is. Or maybe I expect too much from the people I give to. Or both. So be Phora. Put out music and build your fanbase. That's what this has all been for, right? Let yourself be filled with good feelings of looking forward to the moment, not just proving __Sheng__ right. Mazzi said I'm a grumpy motherfucker. #downfall
                - Rhonda Moore and another girl called me "controlled" in the same night.
                - Ran into __Shady Chapman__ a.k.a. Shady Chapman, slumming over yet another guy who’s conspicuously not the Libyan in the picture. She complimented my eyes again. Asked me to play cards, I declined, doing my __aloof__ thing, she called me arrogant, exit. Never mind the fact that she didn’t even remember me when she saw me the second time. 
                - __aloof__ at Turtle Lake Brewery. But actually just __tired__ of my own bullshit. A transsexual asked me if I was okay. #Hanoi 
                - Am I demanding? Seems like a stupid thing to ask, with an album called Great Expectations. But after a conversation with a 20-year-old kid named TJ where I realized I might be a little idealistic to just tell him that this company which is currently one weird guy operating out of a coffeeshop is going to need his entire life and deserve it… maybe I am. I called him loopy for asking good questions, although he didn’t phrase them too well. I expect women to just give me the pussy then watch me fuck someone else. I expect people to listen to deep music, read long stories.

                - "Haha you care a lot about how others see you. Interesting!" The case for __validation__, for caring what other people think of you. Validation from others basically is a signal that "it's safe to come out, James. We aren't going to hurt you."
                - Traveling around the world trying to be accepted by one country after another. #1bag
                    - And on a Saturday where I’m doing everything right at Starbucks having a long deep conversation with Dylan about this company of ours and Jun walks in, this pretty, tight girl who likes me so much she can’t even pat me correctly. And she’s not hungry when I am so I buy a crappy sandwich just to sit next to her and say nothing when I should be talking to her, learning about her, but all I end up doing is enjoying the sun, which does feel pretty good, then I leave her alone to go and sit alone in an office and delete people and mp3s and songs and lines and ideas and women and countries and futures and dreams. Wanted Africa to accept me and ended up in jail. Wanted to be American and threw all my shit away and left. Now I learn Vietnamese and wait for the cops to show up to the office or a white person to tell me it’s all over. love
                - Martha ran into Freddy, the weird shaped old kid who worked at Jojo’s, and he said “James treated himself like shit”. I take a little pride in that. But it would be nice to be able to allow all this. When I look through all the memories I’ve amassed whether through pictures or videos or words, my instinct is to try to cull it all down. Let’s try to allow the mess. You have space to spend. You have a lot of ideas. Basically, relax a bit. Let your life breathe. You have a lot. Do a lot. You don’t have to push them all through. Mom said “you’re still so faithful to your music”. You are faithful to people and your dreams. Actually feeling like an idiot savant, looking through all these pictures and videos and albums and ideas that amass daily in word docs and outlook notes and new cloud storage and none of it comes out. __Sheng__ told you in 30 minutes flat that you aren’t chasing your music dreams because you can’t take criticism. Galdjie never met someone so motivated by approval. Devakhi said I live like it’s me against the world. Mom said I have a deep sadness. Frank said I care about nothing. Afsoon said I care about everything. Some people can see how constipated you are. You do a powerful thing here with this journal. So let’s put it to best use. After 12 years of writing it and seven years in the wilderness, what do we know about you? And what will we change.

                - You have to stop gchatting. Internet chat always gets you. You love the distance, the nonchalance, catching a woman in a personal moment and surfing right into her brain with your written word. But it’s a waste of time.
            - __emo__
            - __philophobe__
                - Junot Diaz says classic trauma is approaching then pulling back.
                - A girl on Tinder says "simple, ordinary Vietnamese girl" and my blood boils. I resent and am __jealous__of people who are content with themselves. Especially ones in their own countries, while I do all this pushing and discipline and growth and moving around. #[[Vietnamese girls]]
                - [[mom]] loved [[dad]] and it got her hurt. It's weakness in my mind.
                - __Ah crap,__ the first thing I think about when I hear a good song. Love fucks up my concentration. 
                - Free confident happy people who are open about it and love, bug me.
                - I like Buffalo 66 because it's an __emo__ swarthy guy fighting love. #me

            - __tired__
            - __halfass__
                - Taking good hard looks at things and realizing that everything you did was actually __halfass__. Quality has a meaning, and you didn't know or wanna know, and you did a lot of work maybe for you, but nothing like what true winners, truly exemplary people need to do, and you just didn't take it all the way, simple as that. Steamroll anything you want done. Go way overboard.
                - Reading my diary. I was given a magazine, Rime. I blew that. I was djing three, four nights a week. I didn't take that seriously. I like to tell people that here in Vietnam I'm finally taking something seriously before I lose it, not after.
                - Does Beyonce spend a few hours reorganizing her mp3s?
                - Everything came down like a Jenga tower with Ma. It always does. I looked back at my indecisiveness with Nikiya, with my career, with buying a house. I felt like the few decisions I actually made in my life were wrong. My whole grown life has been symptomatic of a man who wants to keep all his options open, and therefore has nothing for himself. 
                - You’ve always had a big mouth. Always thought shit was sweet when shit is serious. Good at details. Bad at big picture. Great at filing your nails meanwhile you forgot your key is in a different pocket in your bag. You run your mouth to get into shit then run it some more to try to get out. Suddenly the guy walking too close to me in the street is an enemy. Who else did I tell? Earlier you were reading Enemy In The Blanket, all about how people’s weaknesses have been framing them from the minute the book started. That’s life. The amazing part is we still don’t notice it while it’s happening, still surprised when it happens to us. 
            - __shallow__
            - __half empty__
                - Men putting [[women]] through shit. Example: [[mom]] and [[dad]]. Better to never try?
                - I see a colorful Nike poster on my phone. Will I still enjoy this colorful Nike poster when [[mom]] is dead? often when I focus I think of __death__. putting yourself out of time puts yourself away from that idea. as if you have time that's not now. #[[The Big Nut]]
                - [[Rojeanne]] runs toward pain.
                    - I thought about how weird it is that people younger than me and seemingly just like me can rush towards all these responsibilities, all the fear and worry they’re about to put themselves through.
                        - [[Kauai]]. Went to the beach with [[Rojeanne]], [[Paloma]] and [[Matt]]. The 5th looms. Barbecued and drank at home. I hugged them each many times and told them I loved them. I told Rojeanne I'm so proud of the level-headed, considerate, wise woman she's become, and I'm also a bit __jealous__. I need some of that. 
                        - I thought about how weird it is that people younger than me and seemingly just like me can rush towards all these responsibilities willingly, all the fear and worry they’re about to put themselves through, while I can’t even stomach a potential conversation with my employer. 
                    - Everyone else swears they are good enough to perform, marry, you name it. And I just can't see it. In them or myself. __half empty__.
            - __OCD__
                - [[options]]
            - __guilt__
                - Martha guilt.
                - __don't be so hard on yourself__
            - __worries__
                - Nighttime __worries__: earthquakes, which is another way to say __death__. Recently I console myself in the idea that things don't happen when you expect them to. #downfall#shnub#[[nothing good has to happen]]#[[mediocre world]]#[[The Big Nut]]
                    - I think about __quakes__ as usual then take comfort in the knowledge that, like __death__, it won't come when you expect it, lying in bed. #raps#cadillac
                    - sometimes knowing when it's coming is better. sometimes it's not. 
                    - sometimes it won't come when you're expecting it, and it's good. other times the opposite. 
                - My classic worry: that some kind of deux ex machina will come at the most decisive point in my life and at that point my plans would not only be fucked but I’d have to admit there’s some kind of God. #downfall #shnub
                    - __insecure__, a daily checklist, but also the facts of life for everyone like me. Chill. #Madoff
                    - George Costanza from __Seinfeld__ always felt fate would strike him down at the moment of success. A white discoloration on the day his show premieres. 
                    - Told [[Sean]] I was waiting for something to go wrong. He told me nothing has to go wrong. He should know. He’s been to prison. Fucked hundreds of women. He’s still here. No kids, no AIDS, no diseases. #shnub #me #[[nothing good has to happen]]
                - The big worry isn’t that you make gigantic mistakes. It’s that you’re so far off the mark that you can’t even see it. #women #downfall
                - Fucking everything, basically. I find a way. Stop it. Be too busy to worry.
                    - I shell condoms at the Circle K and score Selena for the first and last time. Reading "How To Stop Worrying And Start Living". Churchill said he was too busy to worry. Classic Asian woman trying to be western and the world won't let her. #[[Vietnamese girls]]
                    - Worrying about Orfium. When I'm not worrying about having too much music, or books, or women, or ideas. Worrying about the bad times. Worrying about when the good times will end. Being an old dad. Being an old player. Using too many Roam pages. It's insanity.
                    - I've cooked up all these simultaneous pots, and the  more they bubble the more scared I get. I will never sleep again.
                    - You have to be a bit numb to get through life, but not too numb. Balance. #[[The Big Nut]]
                        - You have to turn off your emotions to really give it to a girl. But maybe it's just YOU who has to do that. Maybe some guys can handle the feelings. Probably. It's the visuals that do it to you. That means it's a mental thing. But with a girl like Mai it's the pussy too. That shit is wild. You have to numb yourself up just to get through it. Of course sex feels like nothing. By definition you're gonna be all or nothing.
                -  Will I hate being an old dad and husband? #downfall
                    - Reading about [[Hanoi]] and [[Vietnam]]. Looking at a young Vietnamese man with a young family and realizing that will never be me. Reminds me of sitting on the floor at Sang's house with [[Truong]] and his wife. #women #her #downfall 
                    - __worries__: [[The Big Nut]] will become The Old Nut. 
                - __being an old player__
                    - the night the old player breaks. At a bar crying, like a movie. And the dumbest part of it all will be that gets plenty of [[women]] and still ends up at the bar every night trying to fill a hole.
                    - If I'm still alone to see __Duc Long__ grow up I better throw myself off this balcony. #Hanoi
                    - Surprise, the old single guys are the losers. #downfall #1bag #shnub #women
                    - Bartender asks for 1,000 dong because it’s bad luck if your first customer doesn’t buy. 39, running up on fairgrounds, looking for the party. They say “James, you notice so much”. Easy when you’re 40 with no kids. 
                    - Reading a girl's hate to break it to you, old man tweets and saying "Yeah. Having family in your mid-20s IS a beautiful thing. I was too __insecure__." 
                - The apocalypse ruining my shot at greatness.
                - That I'm not strong enough to be present enough to enjoy life without that tug in my throat
                    - back to presence. fried chicken. if you can't stop biting your face and can't focus you're dead.
                - Why I always feel like I'm just one wrong step away. Because I've failed so many times. Maybe I wanted to. 
                - Mom dying. Anyone in immediate family dying. Mom being alone.
                - I'm not that deep
                    - Reading __Fitzgerald__ again. Realized he was a writer, just into writing. Otherwise a __loveless__ __fake__ with dick to say.
                    - breadth vs depth
                        - Sobriety hangover. Breadth vs depth. Diddling your time away while gigantic puzzle pieces hide in plain sight, just waiting for you to stop chasing bar maids long enough to figure it out. A company of thieves and nerds, and you, the only person who might actually understand everything just enough to be able to pull it all together, because you have breadth. You so badly want to do something masterfully, but maybe that's not you. Maybe you are James masterfully. A Swiss Army knife. Maybe just what this place needs. #Madoff
                    - Quality. One minor breakdown, one picture, and one woman. Two good things in two places transformed how I think and operate. Starting to think objectively about what you have that is good. 
                    - [[why]] [I]([[me]]) did #1bag - to be about something. 
                    - [[Penang]] [[walkabout]] ends with me proving how dumb I am over [[politics]] talk at Tree Bar. The most I ever seem to have is regurgitated information someone puked into my mouth on the internet, or dad, or some pc gibberish.
                    - I’m just a guy who wanted to be a part of something. I love. So why am I sucking the emotion out of my life, __loveless__? You’re pulling a [[dad]]. People are pulling their blood and guts out on tracks. You’re scared to get real, because of the judgment, the blowback. Why don’t you be you? An artist at heart who thinks he’s so insignificant that he’s subverted himself into a smalltime international playboy hustler who does it all but enjoys very little of it, going home and second guessing all the fun he supposedly had. People around you are taking chances with their art. Meanwhile you’re over here with three Chinese Democracies. 
                - Team Victor will desert me
                    - __insecure__, a daily checklist, but also the facts of life for everyone like me. Chill. #Madoff
                    - You think people are going to desert you after one argument or a couple of slow replies. 
                    - [[Mai]] and VT and I brawl and I realize I have my own life and it's going pretty well so fuck em.
                - I'll always be too __insecure__ to fall in love
                    - [[Nature Boy]] ties his shoelaces while his insides tell him there is a thing you haven't swallowed yet, that you can't accept, and until you accept it. things won't budge. #[[The Big Nut]]
                    - A date with Hai Pham108, asking myself when I'm going to realize I'll be alone forever. She said my eyes were sad. I like her. Nice to have someone pretty and interesting to waste my time with. #women
                - I'll die of liver failure and/or aids
                - I'll fail in Vietnam. 
                - I will run from physical confrontation, not protect my woman or family.
                    - [[Martha]] gets into it with a cop, then me. [[I like]] the fighters but I'm __scared__ of the fire. End of the day, a major reason I’m still single is because you will eventually have to get punched in the face for your woman, and I don’t want that. Same reason I ditched Bree. Bree and Martha are both fighters. Or at least girls like Yifei who understand the okeydoke their country's trying to pull on them.
                - I'm enjoying mom/exercise/you name it so much. How will I feel when I can't exercise? Or mom goes? These highs will only make the lows harder. __half empty__ mindstate.

            - __limbo__
                - When my psychosis starts taking other people along for a ride in eternal __limbo__ and not just me, and how long they're prepared to take it. Shit, how long am I prepared to take it? #bye partners. [[women]], business, [[Vietnam]]ese and otherwise. [[Hoa]] and [[Loan]]. The vietnamese have taken you up where nobody else has. But they are going to pull you out of alcohol and sexting and pretending you aren't basically 50 into the world of reality, the nut. They aren't waiting for the miracle. The miracle is here. Everything you (said you) ever wanted. So cook it up or suck it up. Stop procrastinating at the door of your dreams. #[[The Big Nut]]
            - __bitter__
            - __loose lips__
                - The Jerk. Slang. a contemptibly naive, fatuous, foolish, or inconsequential person. My [[downfall]]. Flaked on [[Nikiya]]. Lost out on money which I need extremely badly. Flaked on people who came to Saints to see me. Messed around with someone’s girlfriend; business as usual. Talking dirty to your other ex online because you’re just horny these days.  Entertaining just about every woman who entertains me, while somehow professing my love for a woman across country. She was supposed to be your salvation, your light, and although you may think your mind matters, your actions matter more, and they are putting you a million miles away from deserving a woman like her. Total dandy, everything I say and do is slippery. Where’s the conviction? People are living real lives, real loves, real responsibilities. I’m turning 30 and flitting around like it’s all a big party. And in the end, I lose. Because everyone else is taking shit serious and I’m just fucking around. Or no? maybe everyone’s a jerk in their own way. But that’s still no excuse… I definitely work hard, but I’m definitely not acting grown like I should. Taking nobody serious and nothing serious. Or, taking it extremely serious, and just riding on faith at this point.  People are looking out for you, and you’re running up a big bill. This is the big gamble: the 30 month, everything’s coming to a head, taking some big risks, busiest month of my life. Realizing how serious the game is right now. Musicians are doing amazing shit onstage, and that’s where the money is, so you are gonna  have to come up with the kind of show that nobody else can outshine. You don’t like this feeling of letting people down. You don’t like this feeling of being a ho. You don’t like this feeling of borrowing. You don’t like this feeling of not knowing where the money is. You’re about to be 30: the age that is your benchmark for the new you in this business plan. And as usual, you’re making progress, but not at the level you hoped to. One source of solace is the fact that you are fast approaching the moment of truth. Your music/art/writing life plan is either going to support itself, or it’s not. And that time is coming.

                - File under "maybe I'm not doing so bad" #me 
                - I’m a crook. Maybe not even a good person. If the details of what I’ve done in my life in terms of making a buck and getting ahead were laid out, I’m sure a lot of people would call me an opportunist, no morals. #cheats
            - __vindictive__
                - Sometimes you poke at people's wounds to make yourself feel better.
                    - Parental guilt trips you gave [[Bree]] and Linh Linh and even [[Loan]] a bit. Similar to what you said about that one-armed baby. For some reason you got into conversations with Bree and Linh Linh where you broke open old wounds about their parents and upbringing and they got very sad. Maybe you didn't mean to do it, but it was lame as fuck, and you should be ashamed of yourself.
                    - At Angelina you and Loan spoke about [[fam]]ily. You said most people who are looking for a family do so because their current family sucks. Mine is great. She said she thought about that a lot, and now she's staying with her Mom more. So maybe I pulled a Rainbow on her.

            - raconteur, flaneur, observer. explore and notate. no particular opinion. life is life. everyone's hands are bloody. 
                - I think that Graham Greene’s distinction as an observer of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is less as a political thinker or activist and more just as an artist, a recorder of the way a taxi-dancer in Saigon comports herself if she wants to snag an American husband; the way the Americans and English and French, the journalists and officers, sit around on hotel patios drinking pink gins and complaining about the bugs; the way a Syrian diamond smuggler handles an English policeman whom he is hoping to blackmail—and then what happens when the bombs start to go off. The same is true of the novels Greene set in less far-flung climes; the spiritual and political crises they tackle fade in the memory, and it is his effortless feel for the everyday that stays with us. That is the heart of Graham Greene’s matter: not profundity—how hard he reached for it!—but an instinct for the way things actually look and what that means. 
                - life >. fuck pride, fuck ethnicity. live to see another day. because when it's gone it's gone.

                    - Talking to the Pakistani Italian and the Palestinian lesbian couple at the bar at Gaylord's in [[Kauai]]. Travelers like bars because that's where you meet people. and it normally ends up being other foreigners. best convos are with the people you know you won't see much, if ever.

            - intense things
                - Mayo is being ran through [[Anthony]] style by John, some gay Brit who dissed my music selection. #hate After all this time I still don't have a reliable source to just flick on music at parties. But maybe that's because these people like real light, shite music and I like intense things. __Seinfeld__ and the butler idea. That's the kind of shit people like.
            - I like old things, weird things.
                - I like old radio broadcasts.
                - I like old pictures, pictures of old people.
                - I like old music.
                - They don't understand you. Become a famous youtube like Galdj said. Just 1bag shit. You are the star, and you're wasting time on dorks and weak material.
                - Walked there asking myself why do I like old stuff? I take pictures of old pictures. First, because everyone sees new things all the time. Nothing special about that. Second, because I like history. I like things that are disappearing. Things that people haven’t heard of. The Unfamiliar. Musically, I probably like old music because as a musician it’s less threatening. If Earth Wind & Fire was out now I’d probably resent them at least partially because they’re showing me up. Also because music has moved out of funk and soul influences, and that’s what I like. 
            - I like people. You actually have to like and respect people to be __insecure__ and have __guilt__ and be grumpy with them and all that. Word to [[dad]], __Hendrie__ and __David__.
                - [[Sonya]] catches [[dad]] __hiding__.
                    - I sent Sonya James 01 and she replied with "I am always so impressed by your father’s stories and your family’s stories. How does he recall so much detail? From my brief encounters with your dad he always seemed a bit aloof or somewhat elusive, but maybe I was wrong. I would think that only someone truly present and receptive in their experience would be able to recall such events with such clarity. I’m willing to bet he feels too much and is naturally empathic, so best to hold one at an arms length. Getting drunk is also good medicine for that."
                - We're in a new building now, but I'm shaking hands with the parking guys and wooing the cleaning ladies over just like always. Because I like people. I am friendly.

            - [[Loan]] remarked on my dick, says I'm a grower, not a shower. How do I deal with it getting so much bigger than normal? Realized I stopped shaving my beard over Patty, then lost a lot of my hair over [[Franny]]. Hair and [[women]] is a thing in [my]([[me]]) life. #[[The Big Nut]]
            - dick tingle: I somehow send Mom's car into a parked car in the Ralph's parking lot. I tingle when I realize I'm not really good at random stressful events.
            - dick tingle: becoming a person of import.
            - dick tingle: dad and I dodged alcoholism. basically. 
            - dick tingle: Living in Manhattan.
            - dick tingle: a [[tinder]] [[women]] who said "swipe right if you have BDE". After all this time, that's my whole motivation. The fat asses still intimidate you, because you'd last 8 seconds. Which is seven seconds more than you used to last, mr __fast__. #killers A __black girl__ with a fatty in Tiny's who made me delete almost everyone.
            - dick tingle: leave notes in your dailies, well tagged. Just learn to live with a bit of mess. #dream 
            - dick tingle: Thinking about "Dog Days" and how fucking old it is.
            - dick tingle: youtube is almost infinite
            - dick tingle: batting reports back to [[Greece]] immediately after receiving them.
            - dick tingle: bulking up
            - dick tingle: using the Google Drive link to get to my pictures instead of Google Photos
            - dick tingle: All Chau deserves is a "hello gorgeous" when she answers late and now not at all.
            - dick tingle: I could be working nonstop but instead I'm meditating, because I'm preparing for a life alone.
            - dick tingle: watching a meditation video about throwing away the human mind.
            - dick tingle: [[Afsoon]] and I both live in quote unquote tough environments. We are cool. Ultimate __impostor__ mindstate.
        - /idea/dreams
            - [[dream]]: Met [[Martha]] at some school fair or something. I told her I contacted her last; it's on her, not me, which is just more little boy bullshit from me. She said it was Anglican style, for boys and girls to tiptoe around each other. #Dunn
            - [[dream]]: I paid money to make sure [[Anthony]] passed a test. 
            - Nighttime half-[[dream]]s of missing my [[mom]] and [[dad]]. Of looking at my dad's pictures in a photo album after he's gone. Of mom calling me up catatonic because someone has died. Of me dying hopefully with more than what dad will die with, just a bunch of experiences. #legacy
            - jerry seinfeld watches me iron clothes while the tangled cord drags things all over the carpet and causes a huge mess. 
            - I let [[Anthony]] in some weird house I owned or lived in. I was supposed to turn him in but i didn't. I went home and he was outside smoking. He saw me and just started talking as if he sees me every day. 
            - I was eating my own shit, regularly. In a white bowl. And I thought it was some kind of cool health hack only I knew about.
            - Dreamed about literally straining for minutes to make it to the final stage of some big test or race. I had to push my body through some small hole and it was all dependent on my stomach muscles and I was flexing at the top of some cliffhanger-type situation for minutes and minutes, just stuck there.
            - I used some fancy soaps that some black friend of mine bought for his girlfriend and I said I will buy more, when did I ever care about money?
            - Something about sailing around Indonesia followed by an acapella performance of "Jokes".
            - Dreamed of hanging out with [[Mai]] and laughing and chilling the day after a dour disagreement with her because that's how psycho I am.
            - I'm at a party with Nate Dogg. I ask myself, didn't he die? Yeah, he died on my birthday. How can this be happening?
            - renting a ton of machine guns with Ben as the getaway driver and the cops had to come and inspect it and the cops didn't care at all. I stepped on a rotting lion's head and it smelled really bad
            - Had a rasta neighbor whose help I needed because they were rerouting my mail or something. So I bought him a treadmill to sweeten the deal.
            - Robert De Niro came into some bar that we were behind the bar of and dad was fumbling through a cupboard and barely noticed him. then we went to some place and been hired a hookah guy to come and we all wore white linen pants
            - A woman hugs me from the back. I think it's young mom. She has those thin gold bracelets on and I can feel them on my skin.
            - a girl lives with me. she keeps disappearing. she is not real and i know it but i keep talking to her like she is. i look for her at a house of some sort and a bunch of girls who all look like her walk out. i have no clothes. 
            - I was __Drew__'s lackey, shotgun in a black Beemer, apologizing because I allowed someone else to pick a package up on his behalf. XXXTENTACION was hanging around.
            - Skinny laughing oldish white guy in cheap grey suit said "watch me kill myself" and walked in front of a car, laughing, and continued to laugh as he was dying along with a couple other people who flew out the car, I think. Mom said "good for Rojeanne, saving people", as if she was a nurse.
            - Orthoe using my gym, here in Vietnam. He drove a car through it. I remarked that you don't live here. Something about meeting my family on a Corsican cruise ship.
            - Orthoe is in my dreams a lot, talking about music. His early guidance really affected me.
            - I was reaching back around my head to cut my hair properly. With clippers. I also remember a black chick doing the same.
            - A cab driver who just drives me around and around forever
            - Some guy wanted to prick my finger and give me a test to prove I'm 42
            - Some kind of expedition through snow. the family waiting for me in a jacuzzi. Rolling with some Sherpas. Pulling a root out of my hip and bleeding a lot. 
            - Mildred was a crazy pole gymnast.
            - A tour bus. Mom's neighborhood. Mullahs digging through wreckage of some explosion, then clustered around a decimated city block, throwing petrol on shit until the heat bends the visuals. Me dashing through floors covered with cobras for my camera.
            - KRS-One schooling me and Dave Chappelle on his lyrics. Then I woke up and immediately made the "Ah Yeah" lyric video.
            - A parking spot that said "HIV" at the top.
            - Nzinga on my back while we eat hors d'ouevres that had something to do with Fat Hed, maybe he made them or something. A spontaneous street meeting somewhere DCish with VJC and Cee Brown. Some nightmares in that midzone between awake and asleep.
            - I was in some kind of European city on holiday. I walked into a poppin party in a woody mansion like the LA rap parties from the 90s with hot chicks just standing everywhere. Cut to a busy bar, on a high stool, drinking alone. Cut to sitting in some kind of theater and knocked over the cool guy's drink and everyone laughed at me while I bowed and scraped to fix things. 
                - Ad Rock from the Beastie Boys keeps popping up in my dreams. This time he was a teacher who took over a woman's studies class and he wrote two terms on the board and then some kind of symbol in the middle to connect the two logically. I guess this ties in with all the Roaming I've been doing. Then he wrote underneath that symbol many other symbols for a long long time all the way down the board. Then he started talking about it and he said something called plenicism? And then the girl said "we've already covered that in this class" and then I woke up. Closest I can find is "plenism" aka nature abhors a vacuum.
            - In a parking lot. Remember you used to have those dreams where air was like water, and you could just paddle yourself up into the air? You were doing that, just with a car. 
            - [[mom]] takes a piss, and a kid with flippers and gorilla heads on each shoulder.
                - Two dreams. First of all, I was running through a big house that mom lived in. It was unfamiliar to me and I just knew she was going to be in there and I kept asking for her and then she finally came and instead of being excited to see me she went to take a piss. Next, somebody we know has a very white kid with flippers for arms and gorilla heads on each shoulder and nobody brought it up but me. 
            - homeless guy looking like an old DMX shouting at women as they pass by and I try to teach him how to talk to them nicer
            - Some rap guy from NY died and I was crying all over the place and people were surprised I knew him. they said "what's your story" and I groaned and woke up.
            - [[Mai]] was preparing to be a lawyer or something. to leave us. I had to shimmy off of the side of a freeway and land on my feet with something precious at night.
            - /idea/presence
                - When I'm meditating I think about that mall in Kauai with the burger joint where I bought my GoPro. The manager's office at Dariush's old place in Upland with Debbie running around. An empty Dunn House. I think about places where I'm boy. 
                - Holding [[Paloma]]. Her leg on my arm. Finding myself interested I'm thinking about her.
                - [[Violet]] in her coffin.
                - How __Drew__ sucks down multiple coffees a day and buzzes through 10 times the work I do with none of the agony apparently despite having lost his leg in a fiery wreck.
                - [[mom]] at [[Cola]]'s funeral. Will she cry soft or hard? Will she wear all black with a black veil? Will she sniff politely?
                - Gratitude. That's a new one.
                    - Woke up reading about Mark Wahlberg's 2:30am day frontloading and realizing I'm on track. Imagine the people who live in Vietnam with no dream like mine. Just here to live cheap and get wasted. Shit, think of Afsoon and all the people who live all over the world with no dream.
                    - At least I'm not an Afghan baby. [[dad]] saved me from that, kinda. I can save a vietnamese kid.
        - /shnub/me

            - I was flown to a hotel in Miami and sat around in a studio to interview Nas about God's Son. He never showed and I interviewed him over the phone at Pessimist's crib instead and lost the whole interview and had to wing it.

            - Josh Monkarsh, Eminem and me. #shnub
                - Speaking of celebrity brushes, a burly Beverly boy named Josh Monkarsh who rapped under the name Aristotle was always bragging about how he knew Eminem, who back then was just on the cusp of signing with Dre. One day he called me and said “Em and I are coming to pick you up”. Soon after they pulled up in a rented white Mustang with the top down. We drove to a studio in the Valley and listened to a song or two off the Slim Shady Album. We went to a tattoo parlor on the Sunset Strip where C-Murder was getting a tat, and Em got a ring of thorns around one wrist. Aristotle told Em in the car that I was better than him and Em said “you wanna go?” without much interest and I don’t remember what I said but it never happened. We didn’t talk much. He was quiet and popped prescription pills.

                - neck and trap pain
                    - Repetitive motion. People who work in occupations that require them to perform repetitive movements often strain the muscles in their neck.
                    - Poor posture.The average adult’s head weighs 10 to 11 pounds. When this weight isn’t properly supported by good posture, the neck muscles are forced to work harder than they should, which can cause strain.
                      
                    - The computer. Many people spend their entire day behind a computer. Hunching over the computer isn’t a natural position for the body. This form of poor posture is a particularly common cause of strained neck muscles.
                      
                    - The phone. Whether you’re holding it between your ear and shoulder at work, or are hunched over it playing games and checking social media at home, the phone is a common cause of poor neck posture. Check out these tips to avoid text neck.
                      
                    - Teeth grinding and TMJ. When you grind or clench your teeth, it puts pressure on the muscles in your neck and jaw. This pressure can strain the muscles in your neck, causing ongoing pain. There are exercises you can do to promote more relaxed jaw muscles.
                      
                    - Exercise and sports.Whether you’re lifting weights in a way that engages the neck muscles, or whipping your head around during a sports game, physical activity is a common cause of minor neck injury and strain.
                      
                    - Poor sleep position. When you sleep, your head and neck should be aligned with the rest of your body. Sleeping with large pillows that elevate your neck too much can cause tension to build up while you sleep.
                    - Heavy bags. Carrying heavy bags, especially those with straps going over your shoulder, can throw your body out of balance. This can put strain on one side of your neck, which allows tension to build.
                      
                    - Stress. Psychological stress has a powerful impact on the whole body. When you’re stressed, you may inadvertently tense up and strain the muscles in your neck. Neck tension stress affects many people

        - __[I'm]([[me]]) (relatively) nice__
            - A young white girl with her head shaved and lesions on her face asked for money, I gave her $5 and she almost started crying, said “I love you” and walked off. Partially did it because it was the first bill that came out of my pocket, partially because I’m on my big boy shit today, and partially because with all this STD business I have sympathy for people with facial lesions. #me #shnub
            - Mikey and Davey at the Jewish restaurant, then not being very friendly to people. As usual, I'm friendlier than most. And I guess that's why people like me. Simple as that. #me #shnub
            - After almost a year of __sexting__ I meet [[Trang]], who realizes what I'm not.
            - [[how to]] be [[mom]] and [[dad]]'s prodigal roommate, or at least, how it ends up going. Then a [killer]([[killers]]) with a dolly bangs it home for you. Moral of the story: Be nice, nicer than normal, especially when you've invaded someone's life. It can only be good. You have some cool ass parents. #1bag
            - Sent [[SreyMom]] a picture and she said “still interested in the moment… that’s why I couldn’t keep you.” Still here even after I gave her bumps on her feet. How can they still think I'm a nice guy? #seen
            - Weird [[Hanoi]], the early days. I am [[seen]] here. What do people see in me? Carl's wife's eyes softened and tug at the ends of her smile as I explained my story.
            - Bopha gets two comments on her FB suicide note. People are too tired to even have sex. I have no idea what love or a relationship is, but at least I'm trying to be a human being about shit.
            - Lost in [[options]]. A whole bunch of people are in the same boat as you. You're doing alright. It's just the alienation of a #1bag life and all this [[writing]] having you examine yourself deeper. Why shouldn't I take care of all my [[steadies]]? Money and gifts and rotate your attention between them all? Maybe your __self-judgment__ is overboard. Stop thinking. Treat this like someone else's script. Just do it.
            - [[Ngoc]] gets banged on chairs, tables. She said “no fun for you, you always have to pull back.” Accurate. Life when you're __fast__. And at the root of it all is control. I can’t let go because if I do a baby will come, or I will fall in love, or both, and all this will become real. I haven’t had a ton of sex in my life. Surely I can get away with this, can’t I? I haven’t had a ton of outright success in my life, just a lot of caution leading to a kind of sunny flatline. Surely I can have Hanoi, can’t I? [[Charles]] took nothing serious his whole life and remains happy as a clam and fucking hot girls with no hair, and I’m about to put ten grand in his pocket a month, more than I make living out here eating dog meat. Can I have this? What does she like about me other than I’m big and not Vietnamese? I saved her a slice of pizza. She said “nice guy”. Can it really be that simple?  #[[The Big Nut]]

                - Hanoi City police have launched an investigation into some 1,300 dead newborns found in a rented house in Ha Dong District.
                  The district police on Saturday said they had found such corpses during their search at the rented house after receiving some reports from local residents.
                  Earlier, locals had reported to police that a group of five or six young people often brought in the house dead newborns and then kept them in a freezer.
                  Investigators have interrogated the group and initial investigation results showed that no criminal sign has been found in this case.
                  These young people often collect dead newborns abandoned at private clinics and hospitals in Hanoi for burial as a voluntary charity work, police said.   
                  These volunteers explained that they temporarily stored the dead babies in the freezer before transporting them to some cemeteries that are far from the inner city.
                  Police, however, said they are considering some issues relating to the group’s preservation of corpses.
                  If such collection and storage of dead newborns is found causing any environmental problems, concerned agencies will handle the case, police said.
                  Further investigation into the case is underway.

            - Vietnamese Buddhism. In Vietnam, Buddhism often turns into a tool for seeking blessings, good fortune, and protection from misfortune, rather than exploring true enlightenment. 
                - Buddhism entered Vietnam through China early on, bringing heavy ideological influences from Chinese culture. This blend of Buddhism with Confucianism and Taoism created a mixed religion, making Vietnamese Buddhism different from its original form in India. The Vietnamese adopted Chinese ideas like reincarnation, karma, and monk veneration, shaping a religion more focused on rituals and formality than personal enlightenment.
                - In Vietnam, Buddhism often turns into a tool for seeking blessings, good fortune, and protection from misfortune, rather than exploring true enlightenment. You see, people visit temples not to learn Buddha's philosophy but to pray for wealth, health, and all sorts of things. This isn’t the essence of Buddhism but a mix with folk beliefs and Confucian influences. So, Vietnamese Buddhism has transformed into a religion of rituals and ceremonies, while the deeper philosophy of compassion, selflessness, and the path to enlightenment is overlooked.
                - Moreover, Chinese Buddhism's influence is clear in temple architecture, worship customs, and how people revere Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Instead of practicing meditation for self-realization, many focus on offerings and rituals, hoping for divine favors. This has become deeply ingrained in Vietnamese life over generations, making Buddhism more of a folk religion than the profound philosophy of its original teachings.
                - So now, Buddhism in Vietnam is more of a psychological comfort than a true path to liberation, partly because the shadow of Chinese Buddhism has deeply embedded itself in the Vietnamese consciousness over centuries.

                - Plan ahead and do some research before jumping into things.
                    - God, this is also quite something here. People's backgrounds, education, mindsets, general demeanors don't matter, they're all gonna behave the same way make the se mistakes a child would make. Worse is that nowadays most people are used to borrow money, pay later and from what I see, it's a complete bloodbath left and right, everyone is deep in the hole and thought that throwing money left and right at an idea that had just popped up in their minds was gonna be such a success.
                    - My brother-in-law "borrowed" 60mil to open a cafe. It's not a good cafe, his wife sells maybe 6 cups a day at 15k each, mostly to family. With no operating costs or keeping any profit and never taking a day off it's going to take nearly 2 years to pay me back.

                        - tickets home. 
                        - a big part of brand identity is paying someone else to figure out who you are. if my guys can actually build any site there then it's just a question of telling them exactly what I wanted to look like. and then deciding if it's worth their time, wouldn't their time be better spent doing something else? as opposed to spending a month building a site? of course it would. and they're going to say we want to keep the money and the time. what do we need a fancy looking site for? these are your partners. it's a fair question.
                    - And that's the lesson: I want to write articles. I want real music. These are the guys with less than no rules. The only time I ever made money in my life is when we threw the rules out. Me and my rules are gonna have us starving. With Team Victor, you get one chance to do it yourself.

                - Cultural additivity. AKA the benefits of being a mutt.
                    - a mechanism whereby people of a given culture are willing to incorporate into their culture the values and norms from other systems of beliefs that might or might
                      not logically contradict with principles of their existing system of beliefs.
                    - Second, this seemingly extreme tolerance and compromise, however, might not be positive for critical thinking. In fact, it might even result in a certain level of outrageous sophistry. For example, in a well-known scandal of plagiarism in 2010, a male professor in a major university of Vietnam was found to almost entirely plagiarized the textbook International Financial Management by Jeff Madura. Just before that, this professor had accused another female professor in a different university of plagiarizing his book (Dat Viet, 2010). The male professor then went on record and cited the facts that the book was
                      edited by too many people and the country was just opened up as the reasons for him to miss the referencing to Jeff Madura (Thuy & Thien, 2010; Vuong et al, 2013). After this case, scandals of plagiarism have continued to shatter the trust of the public on higher education system; notably, the incidents were found in both natural and social sciences, both PhD candidates and professors. In the examples, we could observe that the elite of the education system was unable of making a principled judgment with regards to plagiarism; the whole society seems helpless watching these academic scandals happen with such high frequency and velocity. This was only a symptom of the weakness of the education system of Vietnam in promoting introspective skills such as self-questioning or self-examination. This lack of autonomy in thinking occurred from grassroots level: the average grade student, when faced with problems that required creative or critical thinking, would be inclined not to find ways to eliminate bad options but to find solutions through adding more elements from any sources they could find. Here is an example, in a survey by Duy Tan University, Da Nang, Vietnam when the freshmen were asked “Have you ever copied a whole essay, a paragraph or more than half a page without mentioning references?”, 84% acknowledged they had plagiarized, of which, 13.5% said they
                      had done it many times and 12% admitted they had done it regularly (Tuoi Tre News, 2015). Meanwhile, in an empirical study using a sample size of 681 student papers, Do Ba et al. (2016) found the average similarity index of 29.06%; this level of match is higher than other studies done in university outside of
                      Vietnam. 
                    - Vietnamese people, as our study has shown, were inclined to arbitrarily add new ideas, even conflicting ones, to their existing belief system. In the language of information incongruity, the Vietnamese, like members of other East Asian cultures, would also adopt the additivity strategy when faced with two opposing pieces of information. What this behavior entailed in the business sphere was,
                      among other things, branding and sales tactics that turned out to be somewhat manipulative. For instance, in Vietnam, advertisements for food supplements often branded these products as medicines even though they were not medicines by any medical or legal definition. By doing so, producers and
                      sellers of food supplements hit the target consumer group—those who wanted to cure a certain ailment without resorting to drugs. Yet, at the same time, the misleading advertisements have also resulted in confusion, and in the long run, possibly ineffectiveness of treatment.
                    - As the pattern of cultural additivity among the three religions’ beliefs, values and norms showed a certain level of domination of Confucianism, there were many implications for society. 
                        - The first important one was how religion, despite having been named the explicit cause of various conflicts throughout the world, has not given rise to extremist behaviors in Vietnam: there had been nearly no religious conflict or extremism in Vietnamese history. 
                        - Second, in terms of critical thinking, the cultural additivity found here might be attributable to the high degree of compromise in original ideas, and even
                          to some extent outrageous sophistry. This is because in extreme cases, some people might be overly willing to appropriate new ideas of others as their own and reluctant to create anything new. What this entailed was an education system poorly prepared to form a principled judgment for plagiarism and a science and technology sector lagging far behind that of regional countries.

                    - the concept of “cultural additivity” could help explain many interesting socio-cultural phenomena, namely the absence of religious intolerance and extremism in the Vietnamese society, outrageous cases of sophistry in education, the low productivity in creative endeavors like science and technology, the misleading branding strategy in business.

                - non-extremism
                    - First of all, the inherent tolerance in cultural additivity seemed to keep Vietnamese people away from religious sectarian conflicts, or any form of violent extremism. In general, when people divided themselves along the line of religious sects, some forms of violent conflicts over theological disputes were bound to happen. Notable conflicts included Protestants vs. Catholics in Northern Ireland or Sunni vs. Shia, Jews vs. Muslims in Palestine, Sinhalese Buddhists vs. Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka (Harris, 2005). In contrast, there have been no “religious conflicts” in Vietnam according to Le (2011). A quick search on Google Scholar would show that there were no results for the key words “religious wars in Vietnam”. Religions co-existed quite harmoniously in Vietnam. In the 19th century, Vietnamese people had even
                      invented a syncretic religion called Caodaiism (“Đạo Cao Đài”), whose essence was essentially additivity: founded in 1926, this faith brings together elements of the East and the west by worshipping Buddha, Lao Tzu, Victor Hugo, Confucius, Jesus Christ, etc. (Hitchcox, 1990; Quinn‐Judge, 2013), and even considered the Jade Emperor (Ngọc Hoàng) and the Holy Spirit to be one (Louaas, 2015; Hoskins, 2015).

                - Foreign companies are backing away from hiring Vietnamese because they are constantly hopping around jobs looking for something better. Who can blame them? You're here for slave labor. But who can blame __them?__ Vietnamese have no skills or work ethic. Indians and Chinese make two to three times more per year with foreign companies. That tells you they're obviously willing to pay more. 
                - After placing an order with a supplier in Dong Nai Province, Thang’s business was constantly notified that its orders had been delayed caused by a number of worker resignations.
                  "They [the supplier] admit they cannot retain the technicians we had trained," said Nguyen Xuan Thang, General Director of Schaeffler Vietnam, a German rolling element bearings manufacturer.
                  
                  The delays have caused significant damage to his company’s performance and its ability to attract more investment from its parent, he says. But it helped him understand the mindset of workers in the "Southeast economic triangle" of HCMC and Dong Nai and Ba Ria-Vung Tau provinces.
                  
                  He explains that 80% of the workers in the region are from other provinces and many of them view job hopping as a means to find better opportunities and higher incomes.
                  
                  "They tend to focus on short-term benefits, leading to frequent job-hopping. This causes instability within companies and results in low productivity," he said.
                  
                  A recent report from the World Bank said Vietnam's labor productivity increased by 64% during the 2010-20 period, faster than any other country in Asia.
                  But data from the Asian Productivity Organization shows that in 2020 Vietnam's labor output per hour was only US$6.4, less than half of Thailand’s $14.8 and just a 10th of Singapore’s $68.5.
                  
                  These figures have sparked heated debate since their release, with some casting doubts on their accuracy and others claiming they reflect the country’s workforce.
                  
                  Nguyen Quoc Viet, deputy director of the Vietnam Institute for Economics and Policy Research, believes that labor productivity figures do not accurately reflect a workforce’s competitiveness or potential.
                  
                  Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the quality of Vietnamese workers is average or even low.
                  
                  Since the country has only recently shifted from agriculture to industry, unprofessional mindsets and habits persist, he explains.
                  
                  Thang, who is also Eurocham Vietnam’s vice chairman, says the lack of vocational training in the country poses a challenge for businesses.
                  
                  Data from the General Statistics Office shows that only 27.8% of Vietnam’s 52 million workers have received vocational training.
                  
                  There is a mismatch between workers’ skill sets and businesses’ requirements, especially in specialized fields such as engineering, Thang says.
                  
                  Another major issue with Vietnamese labor is the high turnover rate, with 15-20% of employees quitting within the first year, he says.
                  
                  Tran Anh Tuan, vice chairman of the HCMC Vocational Education Association, says however that workers alone should not be blamed for their low productivity.
                  
                  He points out that productivity is partly dependent on businesses and working conditions.
                  
                  Businesses will face high turnover rate and difficulties in hiring skilled workers that meet their needs if they hand out intense workloads while paying little attention to their welfare and training, he explains.
                  
                  Training programs should not focus only on improving skills and expertise but also aim to promote work ethics and positive mindsets, he says.
                  
                  Balancing the benefits of the workers and businesses is key to boosting productivity, he concludes.
                  
                  Viet concurs saying many workers migrate for employment and often suffer from inadequate working and living conditions, which affects their productivity.
                  
                  This sentiment is echoed by many employees who have been job hopping.
                  
                  Lam Thi Hop, 25, a factory worker in Bac Ninh Province, says she has changed jobs five times in the last seven years because at most of them she had heavy workloads but little income.
                  
                  Her work involves assembling electronic components. She works under high pressure, having to meet requirements in terms of both output and quality, and has a tight schedule with only a 10-minute break between shifts.
                  
                  "Prices are rising, but my salary and allowances only come to VND6 million [a month]. Half of that goes just for rent."
                  
                  With little chance of getting promoted, switching jobs is imperative for workers like Hop to make ends meet, even if a new job only provides a slightly better income or benefits.
                  
                  Hop has been at her current job for two years out of respect for her kind manager, but thinks a long-term commitment is out of the question.
                  
                  "I am learning Chinese in the hope of switching to a better job before I turn 30 and face a possible layoff."
                  
                  Foreign business owners have had good experiences with local labor. While they are overly concerned about their benefits even before starting a job, Vietnamese workers are very intelligent and diligent, the owner of a Japanese firm says.
                  
                  Having been in the food industry in Vietnam for over 10 years, Matsuo Tomoyuki, entrepreneur and president of the Japan Vietnam Gastronomy Association, has nothing but good words for Vietnamese workers for their diligence, self-esteem and loyalty.
                  
                  "There is nothing I would like to change about them. It is the perspective of management that needs to change."
                  
                  After the failed partnership in the south, Thang's enterprise tied up with a supplier in the north and got the firm to deliver orders in time.
                  
                  While the wage gap between the two regions is not large, the north has a lower worker turnover rate because people prioritize stability and living close to their families, Thang explains.
                  
                  Thus, his company has adopted region-specific strategies to retain employees and develop skilled personnel.

Some days the lady gabbing on is short and sweet. During COVID outbreaks she drones on and on, while guys get balls out of trees with long sticks with flags of Vietnam attached to them.

                    - I order the stir fry mince chicken with eggplant. Waitress asks if I want anything else. I say no. Her eyeglasses quiver slightly on her face and she walks off. Two cooks walk out of the kitchen to look at me. The wait staff slows down and their eyes get bigger. A waiter emerges from the kitchen holding a plate. Everyone looks at it, laughs all over it, examine it, sniff it, tickle each other, touch the plate some more, then they send it back into the kitchen. A chef standing at the door of the kitchen grins at me with all his teeth. I grimace at him to let him know all is not well. A few minutes later the plate returns from the kitchen. A guy puts it on the bar so the wait staff can bring it to me, but instead everyone just looks at each other for ten seconds and does nothing.. I stand up and walk over to get it myself. People immediately start moving so I sit down. I ask the girl who brings it to me why everyone has stopped work to look at me, then the meal, and why it was sent back. She ignores me almost completely. A waitress who can speak a bit of English says everyone is just surprised that you don't order rice. This does not, of course, explain why they laughed at it, sniffed it, then sent it back. I eat it. It's good.

On Google Translate on your way to work you pre-emptively tap out "will you guys accept a package for me in the future if I am not here? Or can you not do that?" I put my phone in their face. They shrug as if they don't understand. Luckily a girl who speaks decent English walks by and I drag her into it. She translates and they stare at the floor, murmuring. She says uneasily "they will do it but the receptionist is better because she speaks English". I tell her neither the receptionist not the delivery man speaks English so what difference does that make? They talk for five more minutes. She said they agree even though their body language and faces have done nothing to indicate such.
            - Vietnam is like pho. 
                - You’re constantly searching for flavor that is just not quite there, but it looks like it’s supposed to be there and everyone else swears it’s there, so you keep searching. And it’s good for you. An honest nutrition, like sitting around chatting with your friends for hours while eating pumpkin seeds and telling guys like me ‘no ons’. 
                - This cool doctor told me 20 years ago when he first came here, they used to line up and blindfold people with tonsillitis and use a stamping machine on each of them. Then he took my white blood cell count and the room changed. “You could be quite ill.” Now I’m at Darrell’s house listening to this guy, this Trump, this L. Ron Hubbard, and it could be spirituality or religion or Scientology or snake oil but at the end of the day it’s focus and repetition and faith for no reason other than it might fucking work and I need it. I spoke to myself on my phone and I played it and it worked. I can’t have this nothing anymore, this relentless reality. alcohol was a break from that, it helped me tolerate all this mediocrity in myself and others. And now that had better be over. I feel better sober. I do. It feels good to do the right thing. And all lines are converging. That’s why I merged these documents today. Because everything I do that’s positive is leading to the big win. But this is still all lip service, essentially another form of procrastination. Dispenza says when you do something different you’re breaking connections in your brain. And that’s the hardest thing for me to do. I need to move everything forward every day. And that’s the hardest part for me. Working is easy, panicking and throwing my own needs and dreams out the window is easy. Been doing it for decades. The day I decided to go to the doctors because my tongue erupted in swollen bumps and my arms hurt in bed and I threw out the rest of that Woodford Reserve because every swig tasted extra strong and I wasn’t sleeping a lick, lying in bed knowing I was vaguely dying but I tried to act like it was all normal.

                    - Vietnam is like a massage.
                        - Sometimes hurts, sometimes boring and pointless, occasional flashes of pure pleasure, but no matter what they’re always around you, squeezing, probing, hairdressers getting in your ears.

            - Vietnam's administrative system was probably far more advanced than that of any other Southeast Asian states and was more highly centralized and stably governed among Asian states. Then the frogs divvied it all up to their snitches. Outsiders just can't be trusted. But neither can insiders. Nobody can. #westVeast
                - The basic nature of Vietnamese society changed little during the nearly 1,000 years between independence from China in the 10th century and the French conquest in the 19th century. Viet Nam, named Đại Việt (Great Viet) was a stable nation, but village autonomy was a key feature. Villages had a unified culture centered around harmony related to the religion of the spirits of nature and the peaceful nature of Buddhism. While the sovereign was the ultimate source of political authority, a saying was, "The Sovereign's Laws end at the village gate". The sovereign was the final dispenser of justice, law, and supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, as well as overseer of religious rituals. Administration was carried out by mandarins who were trained exactly like their Chinese counterparts (i.e. by rigorous study of Confucian texts). Overall, Vietnam remained very efficiently and stably governed except in times of war and dynastic breakdown. No serious challenge to the sovereign's authority ever arose, as titles of nobility were bestowed purely as honors and were not hereditary. Periodic land reforms broke up large estates and ensured that powerful landowners could not emerge. No religious/priestly class ever arose outside of the mandarins either. This stagnant absolutism ensured a stable, well-ordered society, but also resistance to social, cultural, or technological innovations. Reformers looked only to the past for inspiration.
                - In 1905, a Frenchman observed that “Traditional Annamite society, so well organized to satisfy the needs of the people has, in the final analysis, been destroyed by us.”
            - Historically, Central and Southern Vietnam belonged to other kingdoms. AKA of course they're two people. At least. [[Namibia]]ns are Wambos, which were basically lost Nigerians, like northern Vietnamese are lost Chinese.
                - Tran is Tan, one of the 8 big Han families #Mai
                - Kinh is a Han subgroup like Hokkien and all the other Chinese who bounced to the south then onwards with each Chinese revolution; like the Chinee in Taiwan, Singapore and Penang, they are immigrants who form an ethnic majority in their area. And just about everything they practice is Chinese, not Degar or Montagnard or Negrito, the real people who come from here. Same old story. They ain't natives much more than white people are natives of America.
        - Vietnamese [[tax]]: a Jackie Brown saga #1bag #Madoff #flow 
            - Pull out the blue tablecloth shirt that never wrinkles and tuck it under your Persian belt. Rehearse your lines. __It was a long time ago. I'm bad with numbers. I'm just the middleman. International taxes between two countries is hard for anyone to stay on top of, even accountants.__ Consider stopping by Quan An Ngon next to Daiha but  can barely taste food in the best situations, let alone when I'm about to get shoved in front of a belligerent Vietnamese tax officer. I eat sardines, kimchi and watermelon and take a couple number two visits. I write the cab driver a bad review because he stopped across the block. I share an elevator exploding with pretty little girls and still can't get my head out of my ass. Chi's hair is greasy. We've known each other a while now. I shake her Korean husband's hand. We tut about the tax officer taking two years to get this done. She said people working on this case have gotten pregnant and had kids while this was happening. She says some Japanese companies turn around and try to sue the Vietnamese taxman; they never win but "lots of noise". She says her kids don't have to study English; science and math can also make you money. I tell her they should be studying both if they want Western salaries. She asks me if I'm going to move back. I say no. She says "You so old. No country for old men." I tell her I'm okay to sit and wait in the meeting room but a couple minutes later it's too cold in there and shouldn't I really be preparing for this interview? That's what I thought to myself in the middle of it when I realized I'd spent a couple of years juggling passports to avoid tax and the other government lady knew that, so why wouldn't this one? But she didn't. She was alright. Hard for me to get too pissed at chubby women. I take my shoes off because you're supposed to out here, then when the tax lady arrives, Chi tells me to put my shoes on again. I fumble on one knee with the stupid knotted lace for a while, wondering if I'm really about to walk into this meeting with my shoelaces undone. Down there I notice I've been stomping around all day with Loan's hair stuck to my crepe soles. I rip pieces off and walk in. They thumb through loads of documents they've probably thumbed through a billion times and haven't read once, under signs that talk about Intergrity and Perpetual Distinction, which is what I look at when I'm trying not to look at them, not smiling but not not smiling, a total fag face. I imagine punching this monkey butler of hers in her face. I remember __fuck this money, it ain't shit__ and I feel better. Then I realize 60k is a quarter, maybe a fifth of everything I have in life. Somewhere around the time Chi's assistant with the hairy legs shows up, I realize I've made more money in their own country than they will make in I don't know how many years. Chi says they suspect my extra money was sent to pay my rent. They say it's highly abnormal for a foreigner to be sent here to pay his own rent. I smile and say "tell them Hexa are not very nice people." I show off my mot chut and my xin cam on. A little Vietnamese goes a long way. Back at the office Sang questions me offhandedly. He thinks I blabbed the same way I blub. He's unaware that you can't actually lie on US income taxes. Then I took a cab home for a one dollar smoothie then spent two dollars going back to work because I thought I left my keys at work when they were in my bag the whole time.

                    - I think that Graham Greene’s distinction as an observer of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is less as a political thinker or activist and more just as an artist, a recorder of the way a taxi-dancer in Saigon comports herself if she wants to snag an American husband; the way the Americans and English and French, the journalists and officers, sit around on hotel patios drinking pink gins and complaining about the bugs; the way a Syrian diamond smuggler handles an English policeman whom he is hoping to blackmail—and then what happens when the bombs start to go off. The same is true of the novels Greene set in less far-flung climes; the spiritual and political crises they tackle fade in the memory, and it is his effortless feel for the everyday that stays with us. That is the heart of Graham Greene’s matter: not profundity—how hard he reached for it!—but an instinct for the way things actually look and what that means.

                - The Shining. Gives a bunch of 20th century white male tensions (racism, alcoholism, 9-5 drudgery, marriage, child abuse) a separate sumptuous suite in a panoramic setting to work it all out. A master riffs on visuals and iconic scenes. I don't think it's deeper than that.

                - Macondo seems like a metaphor for the bubble that many young people grow up in, at least to some extent. The Buendia kids, and even the father, all seemed to have different personalities when they were young. Then the world came and touched them. Father Buendia learned about ice and went mad trying to master natural magic and ended up trashing all his work. The kid learned about women then sent himself around the world to become a big man and succeeded then died young.

                        - JB and Larry have good chemistry and JB's character gets less stereotypical as time goes by which allows them to talk frankly and humorously about the different ways that black and white guys look at things and that gives off to some great one-liners. total dickworld
                    - Recycled everything from Seinfeld
                        - They recycled so much shit from Seinfeld that it has to be a nudge nudge wink wink thing
                        - the telemarketer who's actually someone you need to speak to
                - __Seinfeld__
                    - Nobody ever gets called out on their bullshit.
                    - Kramer bothers everyone about saving the mom and pop store then tanks it with his meddling. Beautiful twist on the "road to hell is paved with good intentions"
                    - Men who propose as soon as baldness kicks in.
                    - People don't explain their decisions.
                    - The characters do change, but like Sopranos, glacially, and only learn from bad experience.
                    - George hated every other minute with Susan. George said once you can get a girlfriend you don’t want a girlfriend, you want more girlfriends. Then as soon as she left she was the best, he needed her back, will never be another like her. 
                    - George thinks about __death__ and [[downfall]] nonstop. Can’t believe an old man doesn’t. 
                    - Seinfeld told his parents I like looking – I’m going for the record. 
                    - Elaine was too human. Killed it. #women #downfall
                    - "Although his material was regarded as the best around, he was held to lack the stagecraft, structure and temperament to break out of the club scene." A passage about Larry David, reminds me of me.
                    - Life has happiness in the Seinfeld universe, contrary to what these analyses say. It's just at the coffeeshop. The happiness is being consumers and eating and drinking and watching movies. Instant simple A to B gratification. A show about (a life that is about) nothing. #politics
                    - The Seinfeld analysis regarding the later seasons: of course as they age they would all get loonier. That's what I was saying the other day. Grownups are loony by definition. They've been doing the same shit over and over again. They're gonna go ape at some point. #downfall
                        - Similarly: Watched Silence Of The Lambs. Complicated FBI, chasing a guy who lies dying in a basement wearing night vision goggles. **Americans create these monsters, then create these intricate equally monstrous solutions**. Why? Jame Gunn dances around with his dick between his legs. **You can't trust old people. They've been around too long. Their shit is gonna be weird. Guaranteed. That's just what time does**. #politics #American
                    - Morty Seinfeld. Nobody needs someone with all that personality and character and opinions and needs. Young people just wanna keep it moving. They are in the process of creating all that, but right now. Not interested in some relic from 50 years ago's findings. Old people like me think all that is endearing. It's actually a big bore most of the time.
                    - Watching Kramer do the daily commute and thinking to myself, I was one of those guys. I took the train every day and made money in [[NY]] and drank at Irish bars afterwards and stayed out way too late and went back uptown and fucked a Jamaican Bronx public schoolteacher. I had one real serious relationship and it was with [[Bree]]. And she doesn't even know that. And I'll never see her again.
                    - Realized the show is essentially about [[downfall]]. It's a show where everyone seems normal but every now and then a character enters to briefly shine light on the fact that no, actually, everyone here is fucked up. And the final episode is the verdict. 
                    - In season 9 you noticed the new writers rehashing old tricks. Larry stole lots from English comedy. No likable characters. No love. No panicking under any circumstances.  
                    - Guys consumed by sex. Guys who know full well they are trying to level up in life so they can level up in bed. 
                    - you think about how clean she was, how lonely you'll be, everything except her.
                    - guys who only love them after they leave. who struggle through dates with hot idiots. who like looking, going for the record. 
            - __SATC__
            - __Burgess__
            - __Bourdain__
                - Bourdain. Tried to be extraordinary. Succeed on his own terms. Yearned for love but couldn't sit with it. He was just ready to go. Like me. But I didn't do that part either. He became great through what he shared about the world and people. 
                  
                - Bourdain’s own stubborn determination to turn himself into an extraordinary man. 
                  And after a middling career as a chef and one-off success as a memoirist, Bourdain, remarkably, found his outlet on an unlikely 21st-century medium: as a travel television host.
            - __Scarface__
                - Latin guys: love any ugly blonde, and will kill you if you fuck their sister.
                - Casino vibes. Frank is De Niro, trying to keep things nice and straight. Tony is Nicky Santoro, here to shake up everything.
                - Carlitos' Way vibes. Tried to be a human being one time, but you've gone way too far for that.
                - The Departed vibes. Impotence breeds rage. Tony gets angriest when his virility and lack of kids is brought up. That's why he's all about his little sister.

Actually I think it might be more interesting if the pictures inspire the seed of the writing, but otherwise have nothing to do in particular with Hanoi.
